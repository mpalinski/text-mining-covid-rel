idiotic stranger writes Emer OKelly Sticks and stones real danger shows we should just shrug off online abuse YOU blackeyed spawn of a Galway Spanish whore That was how my first ever poison pen letter began I was a young journalist and it was well before the era of social media The words vile abuse certainly didnt spring to my mind Rather I was mildly amused and impressed at the lyricism of it Then I binned it The only reason I remember it is because of its mastery of the English language Had I had a return address I might even have replied pointing out that I didnt have black eyes my mother wasnt from Galway and she certainly wasnt a whore in either the loose or exact meaning of the word In pretechnology days we referred to such correspondents as green ink man because for some reason the letters were frequently written in that colour And as the years went on I received hundreds of such letters as did most journalists It was par for the course and they ended up in the bin usually without even having been fully read to the end In the years I worked for RTE most of them took on a rather more distasteful tone frequently sordidly sexual in tone they contained fairly disgusting fantasies I did once refer one to station security it was signed but I was told the letter writer claimed I had been writing to him Whats more I even got the impression they believed him But they were the days when women were expected to be flattered when fine fellas fantasised about them But I was irritated rather than outraged and would never have thought of claiming damage to my mental health By the way I wasnt unique it happened to all women on screen And as far as I know nobody ended up demanding counselling not that it would have been available It hadnt yet become fashionable to take womens complaints seriously More seriously other letters contained sexual threats along the lines of what would be done to the personal areas of my body with a razor blade if ever the correspondent managed to get hold of me Then there were the religious freaks who usually credited me with a relationship to some unknown local Monsignorparish priest who was purportedly my cousinuncle and who was praying for my eternal damnation due to my appearanceopinions Interestingly any time my life was threatened in such letters it was always in defence of either a united Ireland or the Roman Catholic Church and sometimes both But I wonder how todays keyboard victims would describe such letters given that somebody being called fat or thin is invariably described as vile abuse And if the victim is well known due to relentless selfpromotion for financial gain on social media interviews are given about the trauma of being attacked and the damage to his or her mental health The fact that such victims are willing participants in what passes for social dialogue doesnt seem to matter Surely if you are female and post photographs of yourself in a bikini or male and post closeups of your sixpack youre looking for comment And surely you cant be so infantile as to imagine you are only going to get drooling admiration But the point is that internet trolls cant harm you they are not in a position to hurl anything except idiotic illmannered insults not the bucket of pitch with which I was once threatened And theres the high probability that their insults spring from jealousy anyway I did once go to the gardai I was standing in my hall on a sunny afternoon when an envelope dropped on the mat I opened the door to see where it had come from The street was entirely empty save for a teenage boy on a bicycle When I opened the letter illwritten on a page torn from a largesize jotter it told me in no uncertain terms I was a trollop in the sight of God and that I was being watched If I did not make an appearance at Mass in the local church the following Sunday the writer was going to have me burned out It also contained a couple of additions that rather horrifyingly made it clear the writer was an exgarda as only a garda could have known certain things What made me feel slightly sick was the fact that a youngster had been used to deliver such garbage in the name of Holy Church And while I certainly didnt believe the threat was serious the fact that the writer knew where I lived did make me nervous in that it differed from the drivel Id received in newspaper offices and studios The fact that the writer knew where I lived did make me nervous over the years So I brought it to the local Garda station where it was certainly taken seriously as an interference with my right to peace of mind in my own home And I was instructed to bring any other correspondence straight to their attention Apparently there are methods by which writers can be traced I am not on social media not for fear of trolls but because I find the notion of a friend whom Ive never met totally ludicrous Being a born smartass Im inclined to say that I have a life rather than being on social media But I do prefer friends with whom you can put your head together share confidences and hug together The kinds of friends we all need right now people who are there for us in the real world not the virtual one And the fact we cant and shant be able to hug and touch for some time to come in the face of a genuine vile threat to our welfare and future may wake us up to the real meaning of the word vile and the word abuse When this horror is over and we have buried our dead maybe well all learn a sense of proportion about the odd rude remark from an illintentioned idiotic stranger with too little to do We may actually grow up and develop not a thick skin but an adult one Or maybe those who claim vile abuse when somebody posts a silly spiteful comment really are so selfabsorbed that they will never see beyond themselves And even a global pandemic of biblical proportions will not be enough to make them grow up And that is a truly horrifying thought We will have learned nothing PERSONAL THREATS Journalist Emer OKelly received personal threats and abuse when she worked as a newsreader for RTE inset and even had letters hand delivered to her home 
3,../data/sec_IRL/Sunday Independent/Factiva-20230807-172, PERSONAL PRIVACY SACRIFICED ON THE ALTAR OF PUBLIC HEALTH Peter Foster Wörter März   National    Some regimes have been waiting for a moment like this when citizens will forfeit data and freedoms to their political leaders writes Peter Foster IT was when James Fox was dragged from his slumbers by an incessant ringing on the doorbell of his flat in Taipei where he was undergoing a coronavirus quarantine Groggy with sleep the US university researcher opened the door to find a policeman who began to berate him in rapidfire Chinese I had no idea why because I couldnt understand what he was saying he said His mistake was to switch his mobile phone to airplane mode to get a good nights sleep thus dropping off Taiwans surveillance grid for those under quarantine after arriving from overseas That was despite receiving two calls a day from a governmentassigned social worker to check that he had not developed symptoms after a recent trip to Iceland His experience which he shared on a Facebook group offers a glimpse of the extent to which some governments are prepared to go to suppress the spread of It raises profound questions for Western democracies about how the state big data and society should intersect as the pandemic takes hold Draconian measures have always been demanded at times of plague the word quarantine comes from quarantino days imposed on Milan and Venice when the Black Death struck in In todays datadriven society such regimes can be far more precisely targeted Since January different cultures and political systems have accepted varying levels of surveillance and intrusion into their citizens private lives in the name of public health In China where the outbreak began an authoritarian datastate was already burgeoning under the leadership of Xi Jinping with facial recognition software and vertically integrated online platforms already tracking everyday life It was less of a leap for the Chinese to accept a world where phone apps track their movements via SIM cards alerting users to nearby cases and whether they have been in close contact with infected patients One local health programme being tested in Hangzhou links to multiple platforms including Alipay one of Chinas top digital wallets to generate a green yellow or red code after personal information is input Green means a clean bill of health allowing the greatest freedom of movement yellow means a sevenday quarantine red requires holders to report to the authorities for a twoweek quarantine Such measures might seem unthinkable in the west but have already raised concerns that coronavirus could be a back door to a digital dystopia of the kind conjured in an essay by Yuval Noah Harari the historian and philosopher The author of Sapiens and Homo Deus warns how malign governments might abuse the data from biometric bracelets using the physiological responses to track not just what citizens click on or watch but their emotional responses He writes A big battle has been raging over our privacy The coronavirus crisis could be the battles tipping point for when people are given a choice of privacy or health they will usually choose health This is true even for westerners like Mr Fox who despite his rude awakening last week says he is grateful the Taiwanese government is enforcing quarantine so strictly Taiwans response has been one of the best in the world he said It is a democratic society that has responded very differently from China and has been completely open with its citizens This points to a key factor in assessing digital health measures trust and full buyin from the public What looks draconian and even dystopian in the hands of the Chinese government might seem benign and beneficial when introduced by a government that faces strong checks and balances The enforced wearing of biometric bracelets for all quarantined patients is a bigger civil liberties issue in Hong Kong where the protection of basic freedoms provoked months of violent protest last year than it was in Hubei Several world leaders with an authoritarian bent Vladimir Putin Viktor Orban and Narendra Modi have been accused of political opportunism using as a Trojan horse for legislation many fear will never be repealed and will tighten their grip on power Mr Orbans openended proposals in Hungary that would see jail terms of five years for spreading false information have deepened fears in the EUs most illiberal democracy The human rights commissioner for the Council of Europe warns it could enable Mr Orban to rule by decree In India Mr Modis opponents accuse him of using his new powers to quell opposition to Hindunationalist citizenship laws whose antiMuslim bias led to bloody ethnic riots last month With a curfew imposed graffiti in New Delhi attacking the law has been quietly expunged And in Russia an announcement by its prime minister that the authorities wanted to use geolocation data to track those who have come into contact with anyone with coronavirus and then check that selfisolation was being observed raised instant objection from Russias battered civil society The scariest thing is that people may be sympathetic right now but when the epidemic is over the abusive practices could be here to stay said Sarkis Darbinyan cofounder of the Roskomsvoboda website which deals with internet freedoms Yet such a system is happily accepted in South Korea where an emergency alert system transmits details of fresh cases to all mobile phones warning people they may need to be tested Names are not disclosed but details include age and where a person lives or works Ben Griffin an English teacher living in Gyeongju city said he had not heard any protests people are just happy to know whats happening In Singapore a voluntary contacttracing smartphone app Trace Together has been launched allowing the authorities to use Bluetooth to pinpoint within two metres anyone who has been exposed to the virus Nearly a fifth of Singapores million population have so far downloaded the app which the government hopes will complement its team of human track and trace detectives Acceptance of such intrusion is not simply Confucianstyle respect for authority in Asian societies both Taiwan and South Korea have emerged in living memory from dictatorship and have no appetite to return but rather an ingrained sense of collective responsibility In Japan where social pressure to conform is traditionally strong the government has relied on it to ensure the public observes social distancing Perhaps more importantly after SARS in and MERS in Korea in East Asian societies are simply prepared to do what it takes to keep the disease under What that means for western democracies remains unclear but as death tolls in EU countries rapidly exceed those of China a country times more populous than Italy and Spain combined the public are willing to accept controls many observers did not anticipate even a month ago According to a poll for Le Figaro temporarily relinquishing fundamental freedoms was accepted by per cent of the population of nations Britain included with half the French canvassed feeling that they didnt go far enough The controls come with softer edges in Europe and Canada with mass mobile phone data being used in an anonymised form to help governments identify where large gatherings are occurring or where infection hotspots are materialising rather than tracking individuals In France around spot fines have been issued However the president is understood to have reservations about digital tracking preferring to ask citizens to fill forms on their honour when leaving home Thats what differentiates democracies from authoritarian regimes an aide for Emmanuel Macron told Le Parisien conscious that too much enthusiasm for such measures may be used by the farright when presidential elections come around in In Germany where there is a deep distrust of any form of surveillance in the country that endured both the Gestapo and the Stasi plans to use mobile phone data to prevent the virus spreading are strongly opposed For someone like me for whom freedom of movement was a hardwon right restrictions can only be justified if absolutely necessary Angela Merkel who grew up in the communist east said in her television address last week She is sensitive to emotive claims that smartphones could become an electronic ankle bracelet the enemy in our apartment There are signs that public attitudes might change however as death tolls mount and the cost of economic shutdown starts to bite In Italy so far the hardesthit EU country there has been scant public outcry as the government imposes everstricter curbs perhaps because they are being imposed by a government consisting of the centreleft Democratic Party and the Five Star Movement Had they been imposed by Matteo Salvinis hardright League party there might have been a very different response something Mr Salvini himself has recognised A government of the centreright would have been lynched for the measures that have been taken he has said Where individual countries land between public health and personal privacy may ultimately depend on how deeply the coronavirus affects them and how quickly a vaccine emerges to enable herd immunity Without a vaccine scientists believe there is no obvious exit strategy for governments looking to loosen their measures without risking a second wave of illness Jens Spahn the German health minister suggested South Koreanstyle tracking via mobile phone data could be a way to lift restrictions The appeal of this argument is only likely to grow over time As economies come under increasing strain political scientists already see Western governments facing difficult choices Indeed as Ivan Krastev author of After Europe observed last week there may come a moment as deaths in Europe and America pass those of Asian countries when Western publics ask why such measures were not instituted sooner In the current crisis citizens constantly compare the responses and effectiveness of their governments he wrote And we should not be surprised if the day after the crisis China looks like a winner and the US looks like a loser Telegraph

Industrial School for eight years As children they knew nothing of their mother Her name was Julia A Dubliner she ended up spending most of her life working in a Magdalene Laundry in a Cork convent She died aged and was buried in a grave with four other Magdalene women Jimmy never married and he lived alone in Cheltenham His life changed for the better on the day he met his brother for the first

Laois She died in Meanwhile Jimmy left the orphanage at and worked as a chef in Ireland for several years until he eventually moved to England and worked in catering in a boys school in Cheltenham When Jimmy was he managed to visit his mother in the Magdalene Laundry in Cork Whatever happened during the visit the encounter did not result in them making a connection and Jimmy in his final years was not inclined to speak of the visit In Freds daughter Theresa learned that her fathers mother was buried with other former Magdalene Laundry inmates in a grave in Kilcully in Co Cork The headstone showed that Julias name had been changed to Frances Recalling the first visit of her father to the grave Theresa said My dad put his hand on the headstone and said Hello Mum It was so sad He shed a

worker in Ireland to die of writes Maeve Sheehan LATE one evening a woman walked in off the street to Beaumont Hospitals emergency department and was fortunate to be treated by Dr Syed Waqqar Ali She was homeless and she had no money she told the doctor She said she had been deserted by her family It was cold and wet and she wasnt known to staff as attending before on many occasions After treating her he gave her a small amount of money for herself He felt sorry for her given her young age and the fact that she had no family at home Family was important to him according to a registrar at the hospital Dr Ali was the eighth health worker to die of in Ireland a gentle and wise presence in the emergency departments at several hospitals where he worked as a locum in emergency Dr Ali moved to Ireland years ago and lived in Tyrellstown west Dublin with his wife Rubab and his five children Samar Arslan Salman Jarrar and Zahra Along with Beaumont Hospital he had worked at Tallaght Our Ladys Hospital Navan and had just begun a stint at the Mater Hospital when he fell ill He spent three months at the hospital being treated in intensive care by colleagues and died at the age of According to Dr Michael Quirke who worked with him at Beaumont Hospital his kindness towards the homeless person demonstrated his empathy Usually he said such cases would be given food and assigned a social worker but it was late and nothing could be done with her until the morning People like Dr Waqqar Ali are central to the running of emergency services It is one of the busiest jobs in the hospital It is intense work and very intense work for locums Without them working like this literally posts would be unfilled he said Dr Ali last worked at Beaumont in February and had just started at the Mater Hospital He had been due to begin a shift at the Mater Hospital in April when he felt unwell He asked to be seen as a patient and was admitted immediately with illness a statement said A GoFundMe page

see our father in so much pain My dream was to work with my father and to work together someday Theres still a Dr Ali and she will carry on his legacy In the wake of Dr Alis death the Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said that frontline healthcare workers who died from while carrying out their duties will be eligible for a retrospective compensation package The proposal was contained in a Private Members Bill from Fianna Fail TD John Lahart Donnelly told the Dail last week Its my intention that this scheme will apply to everyone who is a frontline handson worker who put themselves a risk every day to keep the rest of us safe and sometimes tragically as weve seen today they pay the ultimate sacrifice Its the least we can do to stand up and support our quite extraordinary frontline workers The Mater Hospital has opened an online book of condolences for Dr Ali The hospital said he provided selfless emergency care to patients at a number of hospitals as a locum during this pandemic The entire hospital community here at the Mater were saddened by Dr Syed Waqqar Alis passing said Alan Sharp hospital chief executive Dr Ali cared for many patients during the pandemic and

to Barry Egan about Black Lives Matter human failings God army Border checks as a kid his experience of lockdown trying for a baby with Majella and being part of independenties The Great Big Irish Thank You on Virgin Media One JULIA and Francis ODonnells grave is only a mile or two from where their son Daniel lives in Donegal The singer visits them at St Marys cemetery in Belcruit as often as he can Daniel believes death is the start of a new journey Sometimes the many years between his parents starting their respective new journeys has caused Daniel some amusing graveside confusion Julia died in at Francis in when he was and Daniel barely six I say Well Mam hello there I forget that my father is there too He is there such a long time Sometimes I have to say We never mention you at all Daniel doesnt leave flowers on the grave because his mother wasnt a great woman for flowers He has no memory of what his father was like I was told that he was a very quiet man I know he liked to sing songs too says Daniel who can recall singing The Boys of the County Armagh by Bridie Gallagher when he was six or seven My father was a good singer His fathers family all sang All his sisters My aunt Mary And my mothers side sang too Daniels mother was from Owey Island off the coast of Donegal His father was from Burtonport All his family and my mothers family were good singers Does Daniel sing in the shower or the bath at home Neither I very rarely sing around the house We talk about the pandemic a religious man does Daniel ever ask why God allowed to take so many lives I cant answer that I cant think that way Hopefully things will get better I dont try to make sense of everything that has happened Is that the voice of a sixyearold boy who couldnt make sense of suddenly losing his dad I dont remember trying to make sense of that either I dont know what has me the way I am I dont know what happened in my life that has me the way I am I cant credit or blame I have no memories of my father Daniel never became a father himself He married Majella in I have nieces and nephews I have Siobhan and Michael Majellas grownup children who came into my life and we have two grandchildren So I feel I have been very fortunate to have all that in my life Did he and Majella try to have a baby We didnt not try If you know what I mean I suppose at the very beginning we were both in our so the chances were that we wouldnt have a child And Majella was a couple of years older than me So it just never happened You have to be realistic when you get older He is releasing new studio album Daniel on October with tracks of new recordings including Remember Me a duet with Majella and a cover of Ed Sheerans Perfect On October he is a part of independenties The Great Big Irish Thank You on Virgin Media One So our national treasure is somewhat busy at the moment in contrast to the start of the outbreak back in March Och during the lockdown nobody visited the house he says of the home that architect Dermot Bannon transformed in on RTEs Room To Improve On an odd occasion the doorbell rang Youd be nearly jumping out of your skin to see who was coming Or why they were coming Why Is the driveway that long Its not too long no Is their house like Southfork Ranch in Dallas No not quite Southfork Daniel laughs adding that he and Majella have sufficient space that during lockdown they were able to go out for walks and meet very few people if any at all Also the weather was so good from March to June that the couple were outside nearly all the time They did bits and pieces in the garden It was lovely to watch the flowers and wild flowers grow over that period Indoors Majella did a bit of painting She does nice stuff She is very into acrylic art She only started doing it in recent times over the past four or five years but she has a great flair for it Daniel says proudly He hadnt been at home for that length of time for years Since school he says If it werent for the terrible circumstances I would say it was a fantastic period Underlying it of course was all the uncertainty And every day I was watching the news and seeing people dying and more people being ill So from that point of view it wasnt a pleasant experience but the actual thing of being at home with Majella all the time was lovely He didnt spend all that time reflecting Och I am not a person who looks back who reminisces I mean I remember everything and I am grateful for things But there is no point in looking back because you can do nothing about what is past And you cant do much about whats coming either You can just do what youre doing today So make the best of that Daniel gives an insight into the dynamic between himself and Majella I dont need to be entertained all the time I dont need to have something to do I can be very calm and just sit This will prompt Majella he says to ask him What are you thinking about To which Daniel will invariably reply Im not really thinking about anything I havent got a racing mind he explains Majellas mind is always thinking on something So were quite different in that respect Was the lockdown difficult for Majella who in the past has suffered with depression No She did well She was fine Majella was kept busy throughout because her mother Marion was living nearby in Dungloe They were making sure she was all right bringing stuff and leaving stuff for her mother It was another mother the Queen Mum to say nothing of the Queen herself that Majella and Daniel loved watching on The Crown on Netflix at the start of the pandemic I adore watching programmes about the royals I have to say Before the pandemic Daniel spent a lot of time on tour in America How does he feel about the Black Lives Matter movement which mushroomed in response to the murder by a white police officer of an unarmed black man in Minneapolis It is very upsetting that we cannot live together says Daniel All I know is that we shouldnt have this unrest because Im white and youre black Or Im a Catholic and youre a Protestant or youre a Muslim That should not be The world is for all of us irrespective of whether were black or white yellow or whether we believe this that or the other There is room in it for all of us We should respect one another Whether I believe this and you believe that we should have the common sense to respect one anothers beliefs There shouldnt be unrest in the world But there is Its hard to figure out but I suppose where there are humans there will be failings The basis of all religions is treat others as you would like to be treated yourself If we respect one another we should not have these troubles but thats not how it is sadly Daniel wouldnt be a politician he says for all the tea in China He always voted for Fianna Fáils Pat the Cope Gallagher because he was from Dungloe a local man He lost his seat in the last election I dont know who I will vote for now My mother would have been a big Neil Blaney supporter He was a very good man He was a good politician He was very good for Donegal Daniel grew up well aware of the Troubles but he doesnt have a memory of how it affected me positively or negatively We used to go to relations in Derry and for holidays We had a lot of friends in the North We were very aware of the North of course Was he ever frightened to go to Derry as a kid No but I was always wary of going over the Border and being checked I was always glad when we went through the army checkpoint I would hate to see a Border again When was the last time he cried Just recently Someone close to me died It is a sad time Has Daniel found himself praying more during the pandemic You pray as much as you can and you feel for people and offer up a prayer for different things Praying doesnt necessarily give him peace because he says Im not not peaceful Im not troubled personally but Im concerned for the future for people I hope once this is controlled and eradicated we can get back to living Daniel watches Mass on the webcam It was great solace and focus for people Everyone was praying for the one thing that people would get through this It was a uniting thing for a lot of

nationalist MP Willie Redmond as he died writes Brian Walker TODAY Remembrance Sunday services and ceremonies to remember all the Irish who served and died in World War I will be greatly restricted due the pandemic Nonetheless we should recall their example and loss The story of the service and death of Major Willie Redmond MP brother of nationalist leader John Redmond is well known A member of the Irish Division he died on June at the Battle of Messines and is buried at Locre in Belgium He is the subject of a valuable biography by Terence Denman What is not well known is that in his last hours he was looked after by a chaplain who by curious coincidence was called John Redmond He was not a member of the Irish Division but a Church of Ireland chaplain of the Ulster Division Recently the Rev John Redmonds war diaries and letters were donated to the Somme Museum at Newtownards Co Down They include a letter from Willie Redmonds widow Eleanor to Rev John Redmond which is reproduced here In early June Major Willie Redmond nationalist MP for East Clare was based in West Flanders Belgium He was a member of the Royal Irish Regiment part of the Irish Division recruited largely but not exclusively from the ranks of the Irish National Volunteers In early June they fought in the Battle of Messines The battle plan involved their attack alongside men of the Ulster Division recruited mainly but not entirely from the ranks of the Ulster Volunteer Force On leading his men from their trenches on the morning of June at Willie Redmond was wounded by shrapnel He was rescued by Private John Meeke of Bevarden Ballymoney a member of the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers who tried to carry him back behind the frontline but was himself wounded He stayed with him until stretcherbearers from the Ulster Division arrived Major Redmond was then taken to an advanced aid post of the Ulster Division at Dranoutre near Locre It was at this point that he encountered the Rev John Redmond a Church of Ireland chaplain Although sharing a surname the two men were not related Born in Co Armagh John Redmonds family name was originally Redman which they changed to Redmond at the end of the century A member of the Ulster Division he had served at the Battle of the Somme Willie Redmond was brought to this aid station on the morning of June The Rev John Redmond stayed with him throughout the day until he died from the shock of his wounds at around in the evening He received the sacraments from Father Barrett the Catholic chaplain of the Ulster Division After his death the Rev John Redmond wrote to Willie Redmonds wife Eleanor When he was brought in he said he was going to die I helped the doctors dress his wounds The doctor did everything possible to ease his pain and I did what I could to soothe him and cheer him up John Redmond continued He asked me to write to you and give you the following messages He sent you his love and said please thank her for all that she has done for me and tell her that if we do not meet again in this world I hope we shall meet in the next Eleanor Redmond replied to John Redmond in a letter dated June This letter is among John Redmonds correspondence which has recently been deposited in the Somme Museum at Newtownards Co Down and is reproduced here with kind permission of the museum She wrote I am indeed grateful to you for your kind letter and especially for your goodness to my dear husband in his hour of need How glad I am that you were able to be with him and I am sure he was pleased to find himself so tenderly cared for by the Division It was always to him a source of joy that there was such a friendly feeling between the two Irish Divisions She continued I wish you would please thank for me all your friends who helped him in his last hours Is the soldier who first carried him alive and where is he also the stretcherbearers I would especially like to thank them Perhaps sometime you would be good enough to let me have their names After his death Major Redmonds body was moved to the convent chapel at Locre He was buried on June in the convent grounds in a funeral service attended by men of both the Royal Inniskillings and the Royal Irish Regiment Private Meeke about whom Eleanor Redmond had enquired survived and for his bravery on the day he was awarded the Military Medal He survived the war and returned home but died of tuberculosis in He died too late for his grave to be marked by a commonwealth war memorial headstone and he was buried in an unmarked grave Recently local people have erected a headstone in his memory The Rev John Redmond also survived and three years later found himself in another violent conflict this time in his own country He was one of a number of brave clergy including the Catholic bishop of Cork Dr Daniel Cohalan who in were prepared to speak out and take action against violence from their own side Redmond became vicar of St Patricks Church and parish in the heart of industrial east Belfast When riots began in July he went on to the Newtownards Road to stop loyalist rioters who were attacking and looting Catholicowned premises and shops He organised bands of unarmed volunteers mostly exservicemen to prevent rioting  of Willie Redmonds death brought widespread reaction with his wife and brother receiving more that messages of sympathy international and national including from the Pope King George Edward Carson and James Craig Subsequently as his biographer Terence Denman noted in Willie Redmond like all the nationalist Irish who fought in the Great War has been pushed to the margins of Irish history Since then there has been a great change in Ireland in attitudes towards those who served in the war Memorials have been restored and new ones erected At academic popular and political levels there is a new appreciation of the sense of duty and sacrifice of these soldiers from north and south In June there were major events at Messines to mark the centenary of the battle A ceremony was held at Wytschaete to unveil a memorial depicting John Meeke carrying Willie Redmond off the battlefield Present were members of the Redmond and Meeke families as well as Taoiseach Enda Kenny the Duke of Cambridge and Princess Astrid There is no memorial to the Rev John Redmond He remained vicar of St Patricks for another years before moving to a small rural parish He died peacefully at the age of on July half a century after Messines and is buried at Tartaraghan Co Armagh Today we can recall his courage and service to others including Willie Redmond Brian M Walker is Professor Emeritus of Irish studies at Queens University Belfast He is author of Irish History Matters Politics Identities and Commemoration History Press Letter from Eleanor Redmond wife of Major Willie Redmond to Rev John Redmond dated June Dear Rev Redmond I am indeed grateful to you for your kind letter and especially for your goodness to my dear husband in his hour of need How glad I am that you were able to be with him and I am sure he was pleased to find himself so tenderly cared for by the Division It was always to him a source of joy that there was such a friendly feeling between the two Irish Divisions I wish you would please thank for me all your friends who helped him in his last hours Is the soldier who first carried him alive and where is he also the stretcherbearers I would especially like to thank them Perhaps sometime you would be good enough to let me have their names At first when I heard from you I felt sorry to think my husband had been conscious and suffered but after I felt it was all for the best If he could have known how great the victory was I should have been glad but Gods ways are not our ways and he knows best and I think takes us when we are most ready Again thanking you and wishing you blessing and success Yours sincerely Eleanor Redmond From the Rev John Redmond Collection in the Somme Museum It was a source of joy to him that there was such a friendly feeling between the two Irish Divisions 
13,../data/sec_IRL/Sunday Independent/Factiva-20230807-172, A casualty of Dublins Bloody Sunday to be honoured on centenary of his death Alan OKeeffe Wörter November   National    As the anniversary of the Croke Park massacre approaches a family recalls the tale of a lost loved one writes Alan OKeeffe WHEN keen footballer Joseph Traynor travelled to watch Dublin play Tipperary in Croke Park one Sunday in November a century ago it was to be the last journey of his young life As he cycled from his home in Ballymount with his friend PJ Ryan they would not have heard the news that British intelligence agents had been assassinated that morning in Dublin They were cycling to a stadium that would become the site of a massacre that afternoon It was November a date destined to be known as Bloody Sunday Joseph was among people who were killed and were wounded in the slaughter when heavily armed security force members including the paramilitary force known as the Black and Tans and auxiliary troops and members of the RIC opened fire in the stadium A military inquiry was told the large security force was taking part in a followup operation after the killings that morning and it had been decided to search and question members of the crowd which was suspected to include many IRA members and sympathisers Panic erupted when the shooting started The last hours in the life of Joseph Traynor were researched by his nephew Micheál Nelson The grandfather now in his lives in Stillorgan in Dublin and was aware since childhood that Uncle Joe died that day It was only in recent years that he decided to find out more about what happened to Joe on that bloody day in Irish history Micheál said he and his relatives were deeply honoured when informed by former Lord Mayor Nial Ring that an area near new social housing close to Croke Park is to be named Joseph Traynor Way Micheál remembered his mother referring to her older brother Joe as outgoing and a keen footballer Joe was years old and captain of the Young Emmets GAA football team in the area known as Fox and Geese He had a girlfriend named Annie The GAA was a fertile recruiting ground for the IRA during the War of Independence and Joe was politically and emotionally involved in the movement for Irish Freedom He and his friends were in the local F Company of the Battalion in the IRAs No Dublin Brigade That Sunday would just have been a boys day out with his pals Joe would have been keenly interested in the game and he aspired one day to play for Dublin said Micheál A poster advertising the match declared A thrilling game is expected come early Joe and his friend entered Croke Park at the turnstiles adjacent to Russell Street Bridge He positioned himself with friends behind the goalpost near the Canal End The game was to commence at but it was delayed as the GAA considered cancelling the match due to the tense security situation It got underway at Shortly afterwards a convoy of military lorries pulled up outside the stadium near the canal bridge Members of the security forces were riled up by the mornings killings Conflicting accounts were given about how the shooting started People fleeing over the wall at the Canal End of the stadium were among those targeted Joe scrambled over the wall but was shot twice in the back and he slumped on to a pathway outside the stadium A young local man Joseph Ring the grandfather of Councillor Nial Ring went to Joes aid with his brother Christopher Ring They carried him into their home in Sackville Gardens and placed the unconscious victim on a table top As troops swarmed around the area the brothers carried Joe through a secluded laneway and laid him down in a conspicuous area adjacent to Sackville Avenue where an ambulance was directed to find him Joe was pronounced dead in Jervis Street Hospital one hour later His family in Ballymount had heard that evening that Joe had been slightly wounded That night a policeman visited the house and told his parents Michael and Kate that their son was dead Joes father told a Military Court of Inquiry that took place two days later that Joe worked on a farm Hospital doctor Patrick Cassin told the inquiry there were two bullet wounds in the small of Joes back There was a large hole in the right kidney After his evidence Michael was permitted to remove his sons remains for burial He was buried the following day in Bluebell Cemetery in Dublin and a tall Celtic cross was erected on his grave Joes death was the second loss suffered by his parents as their firstborn son Thomas had died at the age of six The couple were from Aughrim Co Wicklow and had eloped to Dublin to get married as their relationship met with the disapproval of Kates family she was a member of the Church of Ireland and Michael was a Roman Catholic Joe was posthumously awarded the noncombatant Óglaigh na hÉireann medal which was presented to his brother Luke in Micheál Nelson said the extended family had planned a gathering to commemorate Joes anniversary but pandemic restrictions forced its cancellation There will now be a livestreamed prayer service for the family He would like relatives of other victims of the massacre to contact him on nelsonukrgmailcom Joes story has been the bond which has united our extended family for decades and that is his legacy to us he said A policeman arrived to say that their son was dead

18,../data/sec_IRL/Sunday Independent/Factiva-20230807-172, Communications during Covid GINA LONDON Wörter März   National    TECHNOLOGY WEVE all experienced the most significant communications event of the past year and its time to reexamine it No were not going to review the Meghan and Harry interview with Oprah although I certainly do have opinions about it and if youd like to know what I think youre welcome to drop me a line Instead of hopping onto the royal commentary bandwagon Im going to climb aboard the oneyearanniversary of the pandemic observation bus Over the past year each of us has been touched by the unprecedented upheaval Not only in the way we work but also in the way we study shop date gather eat and nearly every other form of social interaction For today Id like to reflect on some positive changes in communications we can adapt through the story of Mohammed Rashid CEO of Safco Fine Foods Mohammed founded the company which specializes in vegan and glutenfree sauces and food in Earlier this month he won the Entrepreneurial Spirit category during the Local Enterprise Awards But its been a long journey to that distinction beginning when Mohammed left his home of Bangladesh in to take up his first job in Ireland at a restaurant in Galway From server to bartender to chef to running his own restaurant in a customer advised him to expand even further A restaurant only feeds a few Why dont you expand more widerange What more could you do Mohammed recalled the diner asking him That diner was iconic broadcaster Marian Finucane She was a great influence on my ambition I went into manufacturing I am now proud to say my products are distributed all over the country as well as to parts of the UK and France Ive actually expanded during this year he added Mohammed shared that one of his secrets to success and perhaps one of yours too if you adapt this approach is to make the best use of the quiet times when situations are difficult I am always thinking about how to grow he explained And during Covid time I thought I can get a better deal on a bigger manufacturing facility When I made the bid I was full of confidence that I had more bargaining power and I achieved my goal Whether your vision is inspired by the words of someone else or growing from within you becoming relentless and strategic in your pursuit can pay dividends FOCUS YOUR ONLINE NETWORKING AND CONNECTING For Mohammed making meaningful and lasting friendships is another key part of growing his business and a treasured part of the legacy left to him by his father My father was also in the food business He encouraged me to welcome learning new things and meeting new people I love friends he summed up Like Mohammed I enjoy making friends But once social distancing and lockdown hit there were no more inperson networking events to attend or business conferences to fly to It felt like opening a time capsule as I reread my first pandemictriggered cancellation email sent by a client one year ago Coronavirus has impacted our planned events for much of the coming months and the sessions our speakers were scheduled for have now been cancelled We are hopeful that they will be rescheduled for later in the year Of course they were not Not inperson anyway Our offices and schools moved into our living rooms kitchens and bedrooms We became dependent on devices for team meetings prospect calls interviews and conferences Accordingly usage of online devices to support these activities went up But so have the numbers on social networks Not just to spread fake news but also to establish new friends and professional relationships Mohammed said he expanded his reach as he dedicated more focus to social media I look on Facebook Twitter and LinkedIn for people and groups who appear to be helping somebody Mohammed said I tell them Im happy to help out and donate my time and my food People are delighted to connect For instance during the pandemic Mohammed reached out to the Muslim Sisters of Eire a voluntary organisation dedicated to promoting integration I found them on Facebook and throughout the lockdown they have been providing free meals for homeless people every Friday evening in front of Dublins GPO I donate soups wraps and veggie burgers One night they asked me if I could bring a special food box for a family who had Covid and I did Then I also stayed and served food from around until I saw so many young children and I thought this is only one day I wonder where they are the rest of the week Obviously it was this kind of caring heart that earned Mohammed the LEO Spirit Award I asked him who guided him into this area of community communications I always see my dad during these times said Mohammed He was also a great social worker He helped build schools I was the youngest in the family and I always remember him helping out in the community My belief is that if I am helping someone its an investment to God and it will come back to me I dont care about race or religion Were all human on the same one planet With corporate clients on five continents Gina London is a premier communications strategy structure and delivery expert She

19,../data/sec_IRL/Sunday Independent/Factiva-20230807-172, Newlook Oscars for a new world Hilary White Wörter März   National    Film The Academy Awards like everything else are adapting to strange times Better late than never says Hilary White The Academy Awards have taken place against a backdrop of war political unrest and famine but never a global pandemic Like the entire cinema industry itself the event will be in uncharted territory this spring The semivirtual ceremony will take place on April a decision made last June by the Academy so that the eligibility period could be extended into February The institutions sacred attitude to the big screen also had to bend in light of a shuttered cinema landscape Usually prospective nominees must have had at least a weeklong run at a commercial theatre in Los Angeles County This year a streaming or ondemand release would suffice If as some scientific commentators are suggesting this virus is here to stay in its variants and mutations then the Academy will probably need to consider making this years exception the norm hereafter The voting group is made up of members working in the industry around the world That number was six years ago before pressure was applied to diversify what was considered a pale and stale jury What is very interesting about the Oscar nominations announced last Monday is that the previous charge of Oscarssowhite and the sense that it may have been responding to this in some of its accolades cannot be levelled at it now Voting is split into different categories with specialists in each field deciding on the list of nominees This year if anything the awards look to have struggled to find room for all the eligible quality features that either tell of the Black American experience or have been made and produced by predominantly Black crews Judas and the Black Messiah reviewed on page is a case in point We would be used to seeing a performance such as Daniel Kaluuyas sizzling portrayal of Black Panther leader Fred Hampton frontandcentre in the Lead Actor running Instead both he and costar Lakeith Stanfield are in the Best Supporting Actor category Unlike other awards the Oscars decide internally whether an actor can be categorised as lead or supporting and while they cant be both they can be either It is assumed in this case that Kaluuya got more votes as a supporting actor than as a lead and likewise costar Stanfield Similarly Malcolm X biopic One Night in Miami and Spike Lees superb Vietnam parable Da Bloods dont get much of a lookin the latter picked up just one nod for Best Original Score Ma Raineys Black Bottom Netflixs Chicago Blues saga is likely to land a Best Actor gong for the muchmissed Chadwick Boseman who died last August aged After that it will do well to pick up any scraps in its three tech nominations production costumes makeup and hairstyling In any other year films such as these would have seen Academy members of a certain hue congratulating themselves that they were giving a platform to Black film talent The Black Lives Matter movement may have opened hearts and minds but there is nothing tokenistic at play this time and long may that continue After Parasite swept to glory last year it is also good to see Asian movie talent continue to stake a claim at the Oscars Minari Lee Isaac Chungs gorgeous KoreanAmerican family drama has taken a rightful place at the top table with six nominations including Best Picture Director Actor Steven Yeun Supporting Actress Youn Yuhjung and Original Screenplay Also getting a directing nomination is Chloe Zhao for Nomadland The Chinese filmmaker is one of two women nominated in this category alongside Emerald Fennell for Promising Young Woman for the first time She both wrote and directed this hotly tipped vehicle for Lead Actress favourite Frances McDormand At a time when antiAsian assaults and sentiment have been on the rise in the US these inclusions are heartening without feeling like political sops The excellent Riz Ahmed meanwhile becomes the first Muslim to be nominated He is up for Best Actor for Sound of Metal While things are beginning to look very progressive at the Oscars and in a way that feels organic and sustainable there are other signs that old habits die hard Mank David Finchers Netflixproduced biopic of Citizen Kane scriptwriter Herman J Mankiewicz has received nods ranging from Best Picture Director Actor and Supporting Actress Gary Oldman and Amanda Seyfried respectively to five tech categories It is the highest for any one title this year by four But a film about a film shot in monochrome with a heavy nostalgic sweep for the Golden Age Manks showing in the nominations list is a reminder that of all the things Hollywood loves it loves nothing more than itself It is a fine movie but not an exceptional one and if diversity of skin colour in a cast is important to you then you might want to avoid Irish eyes will of course be on WolfWalkers the magnificent Celtic folklore fable from Cartoon Saloon that is up for Best Animated Feature I would love to be able to say that this year will be a case of fifthtimelucky for the Kilkenny animation studio that seems unable to put a foot wrong Unfortunately the mood music suggests that Pixars Soul will take the little gold statuette and anyone who has seen that conceptually astounding film would be hardpressed to begrudge it that recognition Then again who really knows The tireless Glenn Close is up for Best Supporting Actress for Hillbilly Elegy and if she misses out then it will tie her with Peter OToole for a record eight winless Academy Award nominations Lets cross our fingers that this will be the year that a couple of overdue horses finally come in Manks showing in the nominations list is a reminder that of all the things Hollywood loves it loves nothing more than itself

22,../data/sec_IRL/Sunday Independent/Factiva-20230807-172,Features Stress of policing pandemic takes a toll on mental health of gardaí ALI BRACKEN Wörter April   National    Policing during the pandemic has seen the Garda rule book thrown out the window Its less about catching the bad guys and more about ensuring citizens comply with major curtailment of personal freedoms for the greater good of public health But after more than a year of enforcing the new rules it is taking its toll mentally and physically on the force When I signed up to be a garda I never imagined Id be turning a family back at a checkpoint watching a little girl cry because her daddy couldnt take her to the beach All because it was outside their explains one officer But thats what happening And it breaks our heart to do it Gardaí are members of the public too we are also affected on every level by But we are the ones tasked with ensuring others stick by these new rules Archdeacon of Dublin David Pierpoint and Fr Joe Kennedy the respective Church of Ireland and Roman Catholic chaplains for An Garda Síochána have never seen morale in the force so low And both men have seen it all with decades of experience between them working with gardaí In January the chaplains jointly led a memorial service outside Dún Laoghaire garda station in memory of Garda Alan Leblique who died tragically at the beginning of the year Garda Leblique entered the publics consciousness last spring after appearing in a conspiracy theorists video which ended up going viral Former journalist turned antimask campaigner Gemma ODoherty shot the video which showed the garda keeping his cool in the face of increasing provocation as the protest against the pandemic restrictions was streamed live The young garda who had previously served in the Police Service of Northern Ireland would go on to receive hundreds of letters of praise from ordinary citizens for his conduct on the day in question and how he dealt with a difficult situation He took the time reply to as many as he could before his tragic death We have had a number of suicides of officers over the past months This has been extremely difficult Some have been related to the pandemic some are linked to other things it is always impossible to know fully said Archdeacon Pierpoint I have no doubt that the number of gardaí out on sick leave has increased due to stress I hear that anecdotally And its understandable and I wouldnt be far behind them if I was in their shoes Morale was skyhigh last March and during the first lockdown Gardaí felt needed wanted and they were appreciated by the community as we all came to grips with the pandemic But now a year on morale is as low as Ive ever seen it People are fed up with lockdowns and are taking it out on gardaí Officers have more to deal with than ever and they are still not vaccinated Its a crazy situation Gardaí are the people who keep us safe Why arent we keeping them safe Fr Kennedy agrees saying A number of gardaí have taken their own lives in the past year five or six maybe We are there when these things happen and offer what support we can Suicides can be down to a number of things Work pressure can be one but there are often other issues It is true that it is a permanent solution to a temporary problem Covid is taking its toll on all gardaí The lack of vaccination is a big issue They should be prioritised definitely I meet officers at checkpoints locally here in Mount Argus I can see it on their faces the stress and worry they are under They are being abused and even spat at by some people They are only doing what they have been ordered to do Its not just checkpoints they also have to go into houses and break up gatherings and police protests These are all men and women who then have to go home to their own families at the end of every day All members of the force are fundamentally one family Fr Kennedy added and its very structure and strength is being tested as officers grapple to come to terms with their new roles in society Fr Kennedy and Archdeacon Pierpoint say comforting the families of gardaí murdered in the line of duty is one of the most difficult parts of their job I remember visiting Tony Goldens widow Nicola after Tony was shot dead in Co Louth That murder like the death of any garda greatly affects all members said Fr Kennedy The Garda are one big family When there is a tragedy we all feel it Im not comparing Covid to the murder or tragic death of a garda but the pandemic is having a huge impact on the Garda family as a whole When one suffers all gardaí suffer Many officers feel compelled to change their clothes and shower after work before coming into contact with their families Archdeacon Pierpoint added Some have family members with underlying health problems so they are worried about bringing Covid into their homes This all brings a lot of added stress he said People are fed up with the rules and restrictions While most of us accept they are there for good reason some people are taking their frustrations out on gardaí particularly during this third lockdown The protests are probably one of the most difficult situations gardaí have to deal with Angry aggressive people who want to attack them Deliberately sneezing and spitting on them Thats a very unenviable position Gardaí do not mind doing their job They are doing everything to help up close and personal Why is nothing being done to help them An Garda Síochána offers mental health services to gardaí suffering from distress To be honest some gardaí are afraid to use it some fear it will be on their Garda record So they might reach out to me or Fr Joe instead Unfortunately its the ones who dont feel they can reach out to anyone that end up taking their own lives said Archdeacon Pierpoint If the force were vaccinated it would lead to a muchneeded boost in morale both chaplains stress Ive been doing this job years Ive seen the good times and the bad times said Archdeacon Pierpoint The pandemic has changed the dynamic of their work They signed up for it and accept the changes No garda wants to be at a checkpoint sending people home but they do it All they expect is to be protected by the Government Since April last year gardaí have suffered spitting assaults by members of the public forcing them into selfisolation over Covid fears But vaccinating gardaí would not just protect the force it would give reassurance to the public who come into frequent contact with gardai points out Tony Gallagher deputy general secretary of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors The policing of this pandemic has brought about its challenges with gardaí mounting thousands of checkpoints and patrols ensuring compliance with the regulations he said We are the only bluelight emergency service that has not yet been vaccinated Yet we are the sole group responsible for enforcement of the regulations Gardaí are doing everything to help Why is nothing being done to help them

over her court action and comments about a tenant The sun was beating down on the picnic benches outside the Presbyterian church in the centre of Rathgar village last Friday when Deirdre Conroy arrived just after The Fianna Fáil byelection candidate in Dublin Bay South had spent the morning fielding calls on a story in that mornings Irish Times which detailed her High Court action over a skiing accident in Andorra in while on a press trip on behalf of the Irish Independent This is something Ive never experienced before Just because you are running in a byelection somebody is looking for something to hit you with Why would somebody call this a claims culture when I am like a really careful mother bringing up my children on my own Do you think that thats funny for me to have that she says pointing to pictures she has brought with her of her left leg after hip and femur replacement surgery A massive scar and heavy bruising are evident Conroy says she was told she could have lost her leg and that the damage caused by slipping on the ski slope left it two centimetres shorter than her right Do you think I wanted that to get some money Oh gosh I dont think anybody realises what I tried to do to survive and keep my house going etcetera The newspaper report of her case was also accompanied by pictures from Conroys Facebook page of her sitting on a horse and a motorbike during the local election campaign I think its outrageous that they would actually think there is something wrong with that she says I used to be able to do horse riding I couldnt anymore and I thought Ill just see if I can book to go up there and take a canvass card and sit on a horse Of course its very hard to get up on a horse but once you do you can actually do that but theres no way I could properly ride a horse and its the same with the other thing the picture of her on a motorbike I wasnt going Oh my god what if somebody sees this I better not do it I am not like that I am going Wouldnt it be great to be able to do this In her legal filing she alleges the skitour company Crystal Holidays was negligent as there was very little snow on the slopes the groups ski instructor failed to properly monitor her and refused her request to take a break Crystal Holidays is contesting the case Its solicitors did not respond to a request for comment Conroy says she was on a crutch for all of before and after her operation that summer After our interview she texts me a picture of her on a crutch in a group photo which she says is from November Her surgeon told her she may need a replacement every years Her medical bills have run to around € so far and she is seeking damages in case she cannot afford to pay health insurance in the future Its a mistake that somebody made on my behalf and caused some really serious injury and so because its an international company could they just please take care of me Its not a case of give me she says She doesnt know how much is being sought in damages nor does her solicitor Peter Boyle who told me in a brief phone call last Friday No one has put a figure on that A hearing before the High Court has been delayed due to the pandemic Her original legal representatives were Madigans Solicitors the former law firm of Minister of State Josepha Madigan who Conroy says initially handled the case I had spoken to a few solicitors and because she lives close in the area I thought it would be easier to go see somebody in the area It was nothing to do with politics Through a spokesman Madigan who was a Fine Gael councillor at the time declined to comment Conroy has been in politics less than three years She joined Fianna Fáil in late having been impressed by Micheál Martins Uturn on abortion rights and the partys historic track record of building houses Elected to Dublin City Council in she ran in neighbouring Dublin Rathdown in last years general election polling just votes I am not a councillor in that area and I had a threeweek canvass she says by way of explanation She was nominated to run in the Dublin Bay South byelection without a contest Her campaign is being run by Jim OCallaghan the local TD who brought her into the organisation and is widely seen as a future Fianna Fáil leadership contender Before politics Conroy an art dealer architectural consultant and more recently a barrister came to prominence after revealing in that she was the woman who had anonymously taken a case to the European Court of Human Rights D versus Ireland in relation to Irelands restrictive abortion laws in While pregnant with twins in January she learned that one of the babies had died in the womb and the other was diagnosed with a fatal abnormality She opted to terminate her pregnancy but was shocked to learn she could not do so here instead having to travel to Belfast Her case was dismissed because she had not exhausted her legal options in Ireland Conroys Twitter biography states I took Irelands first Human Rights case D v Ireland ECHR I started REPEAL a claim some in the prochoice movement would take issue with I am told that by the Irish Times she says pointing to a copy of the newspaper from March that she also brought with her At one point she quotes a passage from the newspaper report that praised her courage for telling her story under her Irish name Deirdre de Barra Like other candidates including Fine Gaels James Geoghegan and Sinn Féins Lynn Boylan Conroy does not actually live in Dublin Bay South She has a home in Clonskeagh where she rented rooms to lodgers during the last recession She chronicled her experiences on her Diary of a Dublin Landlady blog in and with some posts drawing controversy last week after they were unearthed by the website On The Ditch Conroy wrote about one Latvian tenants rancid smelling cooking and attempt to claim child benefit for a child back in Latvia Worst of all none of the money will be spent on Irish milk bread school uniforms shoes or even a night out with the missus she wrote in March Does she think there is an issue with foreign nationals claiming social welfare to send back home Rather than me thinking it was an issue I dont but it was put in the newspapers so I was copying what was written in the newspapers the Irish Independent and the Irish Times writing about people flying in to get their childrens allowance she says In another blog Conroy wrote about pop star Miley Cyrus Youve had more online hits than the children in Syria youve had your moment spend it well Explaining now that she meant internet stories about Cyrus were getting more traffic than those about children dying in Syria Conroy becomes visibly upset at people twisting her words Why is anybody trying to stab a woman on her own she asks What is it that makes someone want to go searching Why arent they searching what Ive written in the newspapers about homelessness and derelict buildings that need to be regenerated to get people to live in and not on the streets One of her main campaign policies is to amend legislation on protected structures to make it easier for thousands of historic buildings to be renovated into apartments in towns and cities People who want to live in the city will get homes in the city not having to be built but to be regenerated and thats why in other countries its grade one two and three but our protected structures legislation is the same for a castle and a cottage She also argues strongly for meanstesting of local property tax rejecting accusations that she is just trying to support people in big houses as not true at all The campaign has been different because of Covid but it is also clear that the stories in recent days have impacted her The strange thing about the campaign is Ive never experienced anything like this she says I obviously dont know about political systems that somebody is trying to find out something to knock me and its about me having to rent a room and write funny stories about it in the recession and me having to take a case over me practically losing a leg On whether she can win a Dáil seat next month she is hesitant These are some things that I dont think in that way but I always have great hope for doing the right thing and getting to where you should be Why is anybody trying to stab a woman on her own

34,../data/sec_IRL/Sunday Independent/Factiva-20230807-172, Pausefor thought Barry Egan Wörter August   National    Singer Camille OSullivan talks to Barry Egan about her fear and selfdoubt of life as a performer making a Dublin noir movie with boyfriend Aidan Gillen and working as an architect with convicted murderer Graham Dwyer Camille OSullivan thought about retiring from live performance last week It wasnt a recent development Questions she asked herself often during the pandemic include Should I be a singer onstage anymore and Who am I singing for me or the audience A pattern of selfdoubt and fear was established Before it was too late she wanted out of the Faustian pact she felt she had made with the concert venues of the world She discussed it with her boyfriend of seven years the actor Aidan Gillen He told her Look there is always going to be fear involved But I have just been growing my tomato plants from seed and I have just cleaned the house she replied What I meant she says now was that I had found there was a safety in hiding at home and taking care of my life which I hadnt had for a long time And my life was falling apart for so many different reasons Among them was the exhaustion physical as well as emotional of never stopping as a performer For the last years or so OSullivan had been on the road nonstop with shows in Australia sometimes twice a year and in America and England every year A lot of the time performers dont stop because the fear of stopping is how do you get back again she says Your life is nomadic You dont see friends you dont see family A lot of the time as musicians you dont know if money is going to come Life has always been very unsure in that way She went to a doctor who told her to take time off Then when Covid hit she had no choice but to pause For the first few months of lockdown she didnt leave the house in Portobello that she shares with Gillen I was too scared to go out during the pandemic I was petrified I stayed at home and Aidan went out and took care of things She started painting drawing sewing practising head stands She used to hula hoop for an hour every morning to Ireland AM on Virgin TV She exercised furiously Then one day three months into the first lockdown in she stopped I said Fk that Wheres the chocolate I need to have drinks Im going the other way Im not exercising anymore She woke up several times in bed with her sunglasses and clothes on next to her boyfriend having had a few drinks and dancing in the garden the night before Aidan has said to me a few times Youve got to stop doing that There was something else going on as there invariably is with Camille OSullivan who is on a perpetual search for deeper meaning Continued onnext page Continued from previous page What happens when youre a performer is your real life disappears and your life on stage becomes your real life and you cant decipher between the two she says You are constantly going from a hotel room to an airport Then everything stops and you are scared because you didnt know what this meant I had to take care of my life The pandemic was life giving me a break a chance to slow down or even stop Still she has plainly discarded any lessons learned in lockdown about slowing down because she has more shows and projects coming up than ever No matter how much she protests Even this morning I said to myself Do these next gigs give them your all and see if you still want to do this Three weeks ago she played the Wilderness Festival in Oxford with a orchestra to fans She has a soldout show at Belfasts Cathedral Quarter Arts Festival coming up in September and dates in Dublin Galway Cork and Wexford into November Theres a weeklong residency in London in late November before she heads to New York for a fiveweek stint She has rented an apartment overlooking Times Square for her young daughter Leila to spend Christmas in New York with her Next year is already busy with a diverse series of projects Among the highlights are a tour around England with a production of Shakespeares The Rape of Lucrece and a workshop with The Abbey Then there are the new albums due for release an interpretation of Irish songs past and present plus a piano collection of the lesserknown songs of Nick Cave But of course the thing I really want to do is write to Nick Cave and ask Would you ever write us a song or sing with me she says Why doesnt she Because Im shy Because he might say to me Id hate to work with you I have a lot of confidence and a lot of lack of confidence A lot of artists maybe think they are great I dont think that at all As a child Camille used to run away to hide behind the curtains whenever there was a knock on the door I can remember being by the metal lockers in school in Cork and being completely overwhelmed with shyness and knowing that I gambolled when I got nervous she says And that hasnt left me Does she ever feel on the verge of a nervous breakdown Ive probably been through it a few times and I probably didnt know I was going through it My whole show onstage is about sharing my emotions So doing a gig and not coming down afterwards and being out until and then getting up to get a plane that takes its toll on you Youre also dealing with a world of social media where people are quite brutal It is not quite you look fat in that dress and you are a terrible singer though I have had that before By her own admission she is thinskinned Someone told her in Australia at a CD signing a few years ago that she had put on weight The comment hurt My emotions are on the outside I am quite fragile I am not someone who goes around thinking how wonderful I am That is the struggle I have as a performer Does her fragility ever come close to cracking Of course it does That was for the most part times in the past when relationships were going bad and that was probably the best time I sang because you are right in a place where you can inhabit the sadness of the songs And probably being halfFrench and being Church of Ireland growing up in quite a Catholic village I think there is a slight battle going on While she was born in London to a French mother MarieJose and her Irish English father Denis she was reared in the Cork village of Passage West with her elder sister Victoria Ive been in Ireland since I was a baby she says In June she became an Irish citizen That was fun doing the Zoom ceremony singing along in the living room to the Garda Band she says She studied art at the National College of Art and Design in Dublin in but changed to architecture at University College Dublin It was there that she joined the drama society and in sang in a production of Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris She graduated with first class honours from UCD in and practiced as an architect while becoming increasingly successful as a singer with shows around Dublin In she worked in an architects office in Dublin with Graham Dwyer who would be subsequently convicted for the gruesome murder of Elaine OHara in August Im not going to get into that but I would never have thought it I think after that I question nearly everybody I have met I just thought I dont know any more Because you think you have a good idea about somebody and then you realise you dont In she quit her job as an architect to pursue life as a singer Her sister asked her why she wanted to go through the anguish of performing in front of an audience when she was so shy She said she needed to perform despite her dread of going onstage OSullivan often makes jokes about being half mad and has spent time in therapy over the years But never for too long I dont know if thats because they think they cant sort me I suppose at times you feel a bit lost in your life and you feel you need to talk to somebody I went to some therapists and wasnt getting the answers I realised I was going to the wrong ones where I speak and they dont say anything back That was driving me mad Her mother warned her against the music business saying Dont become a singer and perform Youre too sensitive The trouble is that sensitivity works well if you are singing but it is shit if youre an easily embarrassed Cork girl like me she says I do things on stage in front of a thousand people and then Im like holy shit People say to me you did a great dance there and Id go I danced It was like when I sang In These Shoes on Later with Jools on the BBC music show in Aidan said to me once of that performance you showed your red sparkly pants I said Id forgotten that Im like a child Its a laugh Despite her mothers concern for her singing has worked out rather well In she got a part as a singer in the film Mrs Henderson Presents In she was headlining the Olympia In she played the Sydney Festival alongside Marianne Faithfull Three years after that she performed Double Fantasy Live at Meltdown at the personal invitation of Yoko Ono She and Gillen and her eightyearold daughter Leila when Leila is not living in Ballsbridge with her father Mike Scott of The Waterboys live in Portobello with their cat Goo Goo They bought a house off Baggot Street five years ago and are about to move in She also discovered gardening in lockdown I have gotten into growing plants from seed Aidan says it is like The Little Shop of Horrors When she went on holiday to Connemara recently she brought the plants with her She didnt want them to die Goo Goo however was left with a professional minder The only trouble was that the plants looked like cannabis plants she says I looked really suspicious travelling around the roads of Connemara in my Volvo Amazon with these large plants Poor Aidan ended up in a hotel in Blanchardstown doing the quarantine while I was in a cottage in the west I made sure the pictures I sent him were only of the rain to cheer him up Is there a wedding on the cards I feel having a house together is that she says meaning a serious commitment She admits to being addicted to the American reality TV series Say Yes to the Dress But I dont think it is for that reason I think he is nervous when he sees me watching it I like the theatrics of it its my guilty pleasure Marriage Never say never Were seven years together now she says of Gillen who has been married before Whatever about entering into lifelong matrimony the couple made a film together Barber in September She describes it as a lowfi Dublin noir thriller Noir uses tropes missing girls corrupt city officials crumpled gumshoe protagonist and a femme fatale or two I play Lexie one of the latter A singer handily enough and a bit of an enigma of course Aidan is the crumpled private investigator That wasnt hard and theres a great supporting cast who came in to do even a day or two as everyone was very keen to get back doing something after months of lockdown It really captured the beginnings of lockdown when Dublin was like a ghost town last September In April she was at the Blackrock Clinic for a minor appointment when she saw a name she recognised on one of the consulting rooms John McElwain a professor of trauma orthopaedic surgery the doctor who had operated on her when she almost died in a car crash He came out of his office and they chatted for an hour They had a lot to discuss She hadnt seen him since he operated on her in Tallaght Hospital in We spoke about the accident and about his life and my life I said to him I want to thank you for saving me and helping me You have always been someone who I have thought about quite a lot It felt really good to be able to sit there and thank somebody who I didnt know that well but had done something so miraculous for me I said to him that what I remembered was that he had big hands It was like revisiting my past she says The accident happened in Kill Co Kildare when the car hit a set of traffic lights at in heavy rain Her last thought before impact was Mum and Dad I am so sorry Her head went through the windscreen Her pelvis was broken in six places and she later had to have a metal plate inserted The firemen had to cut her out of the car She held the hand of a nurse in the ambulance and talked all the way to the hospital because she thought if she didnt shed slip out of consciousness and die All the injuries are in the back of my head in the skull my pelvis my hands she says Two days later she woke up in hospital heavily medicated on morphine She was working as an architect at the time but her hands were so badly injured that she didnt think she would ever be able to hold a pencil or draw again It was seven months before she got movement back in her hands There were doubts about whether she would ever walk again When she got out of hospital two months later she had to move into a nursing home in Cork for the first month because she couldnt negotiate the stairs in her parents house with a broken hip I lived with people in their and for a month It was one of the best times ever eating lunch and dinner every day with these lovely old people waxing lyrical about the past I remember the trams and that fella was a looker in his day She faced many challenges The doctors told her there was a possibility that she wouldnt be able to have a child When I became pregnant with Leila they had to mind me because it was more complicated They took out the metal plates I had a caesarean she says I feel like the pandemic is a bit like the car crash years ago that almost killed me Then the whole world stopped for me and I had to reevaluate who I was and everything about my life and me Thats where I am now Who or what am I I feel like my life is starting again now Part Camille OSullivan plays at Belfasts Cathedral Quarter Arts Festival on September the Pepper Canister

35,../data/sec_IRL/Sunday Independent/Factiva-20230807-172, LIFE IN THE COVID HOTSPOT Rodney Edwards Wörter August   National    The North has recorded the highest virus death rate in the developed world nside the intensive care unit at South West Acute Hospital in Co Fermanagh where cases are now the highest in the UK there is a significant number of sick young people I Almost threequarters of those critically ill from the disease have not been vaccinated They include several pregnant women who are now in need of advanced respiratory support A year ago the county had the lowest rates of in the UK but that all changed last week when cases per people were recorded The Northern Ireland figure also became the highest since January and equated to more than times the death rate in the Republic with a sevenday average at five deaths per day So with more than cases in the past week and one in people in Northern Ireland estimated to be infected in that time what has gone wrong The high numbers are being blamed on low vaccination rates As of yesterday just of those within the key age group of had been vaccinated That age group mostly socialises in restaurants pubs and indoors meaning the virus has been spreading through family groups and the elderly again as well as over the Border Then there are the to with just having been vaccinated so far After the death of new mum Samantha Willis to last week a fresh concern for hospital staff is that those ending up in intensive care include unvaccinated pregnant women South West Acutes assistant medical director Professor Ronan OHare says his staff are having to constantly adjust to the everchanging situation which is having ramifications on services here We have had several pandemicrelated admissions to intensive care of women who are pregnant or have had their babies There is a concerning number of pregnant women requiring support not just in our hospital but throughout Northern Ireland There has been a noticeable change in the age profile of patients admitted to hospital with increases in the age group and some displaying underlining health conditions Not all of the patients ending up in hospital have refused to get vaccinated but there is definitely a complacency by some who simply havent got round to getting it says Prof OHare It is putting his staff many of whom have been so traumatised by watching people die they are having to receive counselling or are quitting their jobs completely under even more strain With more than million vaccines administered here those who have not yet taken the jab are certainly in the minority but Prof OHare says they are affecting the entire health service We have patients currently in Northern Ireland in intensive care and they have a respiratory Covid disease When we go into a surge we take nurses from operating theatres we also cancel operations There are only beds in intensive care in Northern Ireland so what work has that displaced Where are the patients who have cancers Where and when are they getting operated on Throughout the region people are waiting for their first appointment with a consultant with having waited longer than a year But the pandemic is making it much worse and every month cancer surgery is delayed represents a increase in mortality in Northern Ireland What stage do you make it clear that an unvaccinated patient who makes a choice not to get vaccinated and gets Covid displaces someone who needs a cancer operation he asks The socalled antivaxxers who are spreading what medical experts like Prof OHare describe as disinformation about the vaccine is another growing problem We accept patients from all over Northern Ireland with Covid and I havent seen a vaccinated patient in intensive care yet Why Because the vaccine is working says Prof OHare The role of faith is also having an impact in parts of Northern Ireland with some Christians believing aborted foetal tissue was used in the production of Covid vaccines The Rev Ivan Foster a retired minister with the Free Presbyterian Church in Co Tyrone and a former Democratic Unionist Party politician refuses to take the vaccine because of his faith Fact Check NI states it is known that a replica cell line from a foetus aborted in was used to develop the AstraZenecaOxford University vaccine but the vaccine itself does not contain foetal cells We are saying that foetal material was used in the production of the vaccine and for that reason I cannot sanction that says Rev Foster He says he has sought to tell people this is the case and many evangel icals and protestants have followed that I tell them that I believe it would be wrong and a sin in the eyes of God to take what has been produced through the murder of an unborn child and I will risk Covid Asked to respond to the assertion by medical professionals that this is simply a falsehood Rev Foster shouted I would say to anyone who says that You are a liar But he is not alone in opposing the vaccine last week Derrybased GP Dr Anne McCloskey was suspended after she published a video on Facebook claiming there wasnt enough evidence that it is safe for young people She is currently under investigation by the Health and Social Care Board for falsely claiming unapproved vaccines were an experimental genetic therapy But she says she stands by her remarks and will fight my good name Her comments have been described as deplorable When asked if she accepted she crossed a line Dr McCloskey said I am sorry about that but I believe these vaccines do not work However the figures show Northern Ireland now has the most deaths in the developed world How does she explain that These injectable gene therapies are to blame they are not dealing with the variant she said a claim dismissed by medical experts What cannot be disputed is that people are dying Asked if that is not an indication there is a problem Dr McCloskey replied There is a problem but there wasnt a problem if the pandemic had been left to operate as viral illnesses operate Dr Anne McCloskey suspended People die from res piratory viruses every winter particularly the frail I have read papers about the dangers to young people If that is true that is horrific Asked if she was unsure of what she was claiming to true she said I know exactly what I am saying we do not know these vaccines are safe The Department of Health disagrees saying the evidence to support vaccination is irrefutable In Belfast where last week of patients at the City Hospital had no vaccine and just had one there are similar problems Dr Alan Stout chairman of the British Medical Associations GP committee in Northern Ireland says there is a pocket of people who are definitely reluctant to get vaccinated Misinformation is circulating so widely and there is no question that that is having a big impact on people getting the vaccine he said When people believe it they share it Over the Border in Co Donegal where cases are averaging around a day Dr Anthony Breslin says HSE staff are having to combat the spread of misinformation online People in the HSE have been putting posts on certain Facebook pages pointing out what is not true and their comments are taken down pretty fast by those moderators running those pages You have to keep doing it every couple of weeks he says Whether its in the North or South vaccine falsehoods do not stop at the Border And thats the problem says Prof OHare back in Enniskillen having just completed over hours continuously on call due to staff shortages at the UKs current Covid hotspot We take patients from all over NI and I havent seen a vaccinated patient in intensive care 
36,../data/sec_IRL/Sunday Independent/Factiva-20230807-172, Brave new world Hilary White Wörter September   National    Author Lauren Groff tells Hilary White about her new novel on an allfemale Utopia Sally Rooney mania in the US plague and politics and why she and her husband signed a legal contract over who looks after the children in the morning The mayhem has reached America Lauren Groff can confirm this Everyone she knows is caught up in a wild sense of anticipation because Sally Rooney fever has come to town In the preceding weeks and months the world of US letters had got itself into a tizzy about what package of swag they might receive ahead of the publication of Beautiful World Where Are You I did get a galley Groff grins of the proof copy but I didnt rate the tote bag that came with it Its levels of literary cachet if you get the new Sally Rooney galley youre good if you get the tote bag too youre really special Theres also a Sally reading hat that means youre basically royalty Its not an obvious place to begin a conversation with another leading light of contemporary fiction but Lauren is reminiscing about visiting Dublin during a stint at Oxford and Rooney and Trinity College are at this stage intertwined I was very very young and Dublin was an incredibly fun city I am looking forward to revisiting as an adult Its one of my favourite places Groff says Rooneys an extraordinarily talented writer she continues I think its interesting because literary fame is so random She deserves the accolades but there are probably a dozen other people her age who also deserve it I actually feel for her because I dont think she invited this level of wildness into her life She is the zeitgeist a very beautiful small Irish woman It is not Groff insists the type of success she herself dreamed of when as a student at Amherst College in Massachusetts she discovered she loved fiction more than poetry and began writing seriously No I actually dont think anybody wants that treatment the says Its horrifying to even be recognised as a writer A lot of us go into it because we can hide behind words and not necessarily have to present ourselves to the public I just really wanted to be in conversation with the writers I loved the most and to do it as well as I possibly could And if I could make a living doing it I would have thought that was very very lucky And it is very lucky Groff is one of the most critically acclaimed US fiction authors of her generation with fellowships literary awards and lofty shortlistings spilling out of her At her debut novel The Monsters of Templeton was a New York Times bestseller Her third novel a forensic twosided analysis of a marriage entitled Fates and Furies was named by Barack Obama as his single favourite novel of As a supporter and ontheground canvasser for the Obama presidency it was joyous news to receive in the Florida home where Groff her estate agent husband Clay and their two teenage sons live But it was Obamas successor who would have an effect on her new novel Matrix Bristling with arcane atmospherics and bewitchingly transportive Matrix comes at us like some amalgamation of Margaret Atwood and Umberto Eco Set in it tells of Marie de France an illegitimate halfsister of Henry II who is sent off to live in a nightmarish abbey in England as its new prioress She finds cruelty disease and malnourishment there in the small community of women but with her position and royal link she carries influence and gradually sets about turning the entire convent around Productivity and prosperity boom as a fortress mentality takes hold with Marie as its figurehead And not a man in sight This book came to me at the end of the Trump presidency Laura explains and at that point Id become allergic to turning on the radio because his voice Trumps smarmy disgusting oleaginous voice I would actually get hives my skin would react to this man his nonstop poison being pumped into the air It was like a Don DeLillo novel every single day So at that point I was just sick of these men imposing their will on the rest of humanity and I had to escape it I was making jokes with my friends that I wanted to create a lesbian separatist Utopia on some island Like we could all just buy an island go there walk around and not have to worry about anything I obviously love men she adds settling down a bit I have a husband Ive got two boys who are almost men but I was feeling the oppression on a daily basis in my body and I had to get away from that Disease and pestilence a hot topic right now are writ large in Matrixs wretched setting It turns out that Laura is rather fond of pandemics and even predicted our current one So I write a lot about pandemics she smiles My second novel Arcadia had a massive worldwide death event called SARI set in Then it actually happens in and people are actually walking around with masks on And my first published short story way back in was about the flu pandemic Throughout my career its just one of these things thats an obsession Like Ive been afraid of this happening All along I knew this was going to happen and nobody was listening to me It was a terrible thing to be right about Still Groff is some of the cheeriest company you could ask for on an otherwise unremarkable Thursday afternoon all singsong voice and selfdeprecating witticisms Clashing with this however is a disposition that she describes as oppositional that tends to always seek to push back She is also less than optimistic about the state of America not to mention the world as a whole In the register of somebody who has spent much time debating it with herself she tells me she is undecided about fictions role as an instructive medium or whether art should merely reflect reality only to then burst into laughter and apologise for getting very lofty What she wont apologise for is her determination to address in her stories even in passing the biggest issue that there is One of the driving forces in writing this book she says was trying to see how religion particularly the early Catholic Church inculcated a lot of deeply political ideas not only about colonisation but also about climate Way way back There were crusades at the time that Matrix is set And I think the Crusades are very much a part of this larger imperialist force that began at that time And it doesnt seem unconnected that this hungry capitalist expansionism was also deeply embedded in the early church This is sort of tracing the roots of where we come to now We are standing at the cusp of an apocalypse we have been for a while Its obviously a writers choice to engage or not with climate change and sometimes we dont get to choose what we want to engage with but I could not live with myself in a moral sense if I werent engaging with it if I were just writing love stories at the end of the world Not that there isnt love in my stories but I also want to talk about the largest and most catastrophic thing thats ever faced humanity Its a moral issue for me to be perfectly honest I couldnt put work into the world thats not somehow responding to it Itd be as if I was trying to escape and I dont think escapism is what we need right now By extension there is a clear thread emanating from Matrixs tale of women achieving agency to the recent recapturing of Afghanistan by the Taliban and what that spells for womens rights there And this also goes back to the Crusades Groff nods This is where it all began this impulse to go to the Muslim world and sort of impose Christianity The way that the US withdrawal from Afghanistan unravelled is so heartbreaking A lot of progressives put a great deal of faith in Joe Biden for a long time And for the first few months a lot of us were pleasantly surprised because hes very much a moderate But I think that faith in him has been profoundly shaken Groff does not paint a rosy picture of the state of politics in her homeland Honestly were so tribalistic now The right has seized on Afghanistan as a tragedy of such epic proportions its like the Benghazi attack that sort of sunk Hillary The far left have now turned against Biden and thats a problem because now they will vote for a centrist and centrists are not invested in change Covid has been immensely eerie I had more faith in humanity going into the pandemic especially Americans which has proven to be founded on nothing From top to bottom weve acted horrendously without care for developing countries who deserve the vaccine just as much as we do Half of our populace is listening to misinformation and not getting vaccinated Theyre taking ivermectin which is horse wormer instead of actually getting a free vaccine that is available to everyone Our governor in Florida denied schools the right to impose mask mandates so for this past week my child was in quarantine because he was exposed to Covid He didnt have it but its just such profound irresponsibility such lack of care for other people Its psychologically exhausting to wake up and feel half of the country doesnt care if you live or die Heavy content worn lightly might be the elevator pitch for Groff both in her take on domestic US society and politics but also her huge success as a writer of fiction unafraid to venture into dark and difficult terrain While she worries massively for her childrens future and what their generation has been lumped with by ours she holds on to a belief that words can somehow make a difference Why keep putting stuff into the world if its not going to do anything not going to change anything she asks Its part of the reason she made her husband Clay sign a contract before they had children agreeing that the first half of the day is hers to write The mother is just the de facto parent and I wanted to make things Just from the start she laughs And so I made my husband agree that I get all morning every day seven days a week even holidays like I dont have to come out of my office Even when they were newborns I would let him take care of getting them up and fed and ready And it still happens today my husband is the one who does all of that Its just really being like this is what you do this is what I do and if one encroaches on the other we come back to the contract and we discuss and we negotiate Its not romantic at all but it works really well Matrix by Lauren Groff is published by Hutchinson Heinemann € and out now Why keep putting stuff into the world if its not going to do anything not going to change anything

British MP David Amess had previously been referred to the UK governments counterextremism programme Prevent Mr Amess was attacked during his advice surgery in LeighonSea Essex on Friday The attacker whom police believe may have been motivated by Islamist extremism is understood to have been referred to Prevent several years ago but he was not deemed to be a subject of interest requiring monitoring by according to security sources The disclosure came after Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a rare joint appearance with Keir Starmer the Labour leader at the scene of the attack where Mr Johnson left flowers and a handwritten note describing Mr Amess as a fine parliamentarian and a muchmoved colleague and friend Yesterday it emerged that Mr Amess a father of five had received an upsetting threat in the days leading up to the fatal attack during a routine constituency surgery The threat to the veteran MP was made in the past few days and reported to police It is understood that Essex Police received a report of the threat but are not connecting it with Fridays attack At least one individual connected to the MP was also understood to have been the subject of a recent threat Despite the threat Mr Amess chose to go ahead with his public appointments Yesterday officers from the Metropolitan Polices counterterrorism team which is leading the investigation into Mr Amesss death were searching two addresses in London The suspect a British national of Somali origin who was in custody in Essex is believed to have acted alone However it is understood the security services are concerned that the incident came just two days after an Islamist attack in Norway and that the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan could see a resurgence of lonewolf attacks Last month Cressida Dick the Met police commissioner warned that the pandemic had left people more vulnerable to being radicalised by extremists because it has stoked distrust in authority She said terrorists had exploited the social isolation caused by lockdown to peddle dangerous conspiracy theories William Shawcross the former chairman of the charity mommission has been carrying out a review of Prevent since January Last night Richard Walton a former Metropolitan Police counter terrorism chief insisted that the government should invest more in Prevent to ensure it can be used to detect the signs and symptoms of radicalised individuals Priti Patel the home secretary and Lindsay Hoyle the Commons speaker who visited Mr Amesss constituency alongside Mr Johnson and Mr Starmer insisted that the tradition of facetoface meetings with constituents must continue as many MPs refused to cancel routine advice surgeries yesterday Uniformed police stood guard outside several surgeries and security arrangements for all MPs are now under review Harriet Harman the senior Labour MP called for a Speakers conference of party representatives to come together to discuss the issue The killing of David Amess during his contituency clinic came five years after the murder of Jo Cox the Labour MP in a daylight attack outside her West Yorkshire surgery Mr Hoyle wrote to all MPs urging them to take advantage of security measures offered by parliament to help protect themselves and their staff at home and at constituency offices amid concerns that many had become complacent about security As a sign of respect Labour and Liberal Democrat sources indicated they would not contest a byelection in Mr Amesss seat Mr Johnson and Mr Starmer dressed in black laid flowers outside Belfairs Methodist Church in LeighonSea on Friday Mr Johnson said all our hearts are full of shock and sadness at the killing of Sir David whom he described as one of the kindest nicest most gentle people in politics Praising the MP Mr Johnson added Weve lost today a fine public servant and a muchloved friend and colleague I think everybody was deeply shocked and heartstricken and our thoughts are very much with his family with his wife and his children Ms Patel also praised her dear and loyal friend as she robustly defended the need for MPs to have physical contact with their constituents We cannot be cowed by any individual or any motivation people with motives to stop us from functioning to serve our elected democracy she said We will continue to absolutely stand by the principles that we are elected to serve our constituents in the open way in which we have been doing so but also recognising there are safety and protection measures that we have to undertake too John Lamb the former mayor of LeighonSea and a close colleague of the murdered MP said Mr Amesss family are in disbelief at the attack He was a family man its just tremendously sad They cant believe that Sir David has gone his wife cant believe that her husband has gone and that it happened at a place he loved being He will never go home again Thats the disbelief its something hes always done and always tried to help people On Friday night Scotland Yard formally declared the incident as terrorism The force said early investigations suggest a potential motivation linked to Islamist extremism The assessment was made because of statements the suspect allegedly made after police detained him according to reports Local Muslim community leaders in Southend condemned the fatal stabbing as an indefensible atrocity adding that Mr Amess was an upstanding friend to our Muslim community  Telegraph Media Group Ltd

place slowly reopening to visitors finds Brendan Daly You need to know something a tall animated Iranian man tells me Hes wearing an intense expression and his jabbing index finger is almost at my chest We are not terrorists he says He pulls his pointed hand over his heart We love your nation We love all nations Iranian people love all the worlds peoples Im midconversation with the amiable pinkshirted Afshin Were standing in a corner of Imam Square in the city of Isfahan in central Iran As Im finding out Iranians want to change how their country is perceived and are fascinated by what travellers think of it Do you love Iran Afshin later asks me To a visitor Iranian peoples most striking quality is their hospitality Random Iranians in huge cities often say Hello How are you start chatting and welcome you to their country Tourists are such a novelty strangers frequently ask if they can have a photo with you It lends travelling in Iran a surreal Justin Bieberesque quality But as my exchange with Afshin also shows Iran has had a troubled international relationship over the last four decades After the Shah fled the country in the Ayatollah Khomeini established Iran as an Islamic republic Since then it has been largely shrouded from the West I visited Iran with four friends in when the country was slowly beginning to open to tourists After Iran agreed an international deal in about restricting its nuclear programme the UN lifted economic sanctions on the country In Donald Trump controversially withdrew the US from the landmark pact but President Biden wants to restore it Iran closed its borders to tourists in March because of the pandemic Its slowly reopening to vaccinated travellers but because of a volatile security situation and the spread of Covid in the country youre unlikely to be visiting anytime soon So Isfahan where I meet Afshin is out of reach for now but the city has exerted a magnetic pull on travellers for centuries Indeed Isfahan is half the world is an ancient Persian proverb When I start to look around Imam Square I get a sense of what it means The square is enormous After Tiananmen Square its the biggest in the world and is enclosed by an almost uninterrupted perimeter of lattecoloured brick buildings in a uniform twostorey design Its around midday Children are playing in the squares fountains and boys are doing wheelies on bikes near horsedrawn carriages that take tourists around the squares manicured lawns and evergreen trees We walk from the splendour of the square through the hallway of the Masjede Sheikh Lotfollah mosque and into an arresting prayer hall Its a tapestry of sunlight filtering through high stainedglass windows under a domed ceiling engraved with exquisite lemonshaped patterns The ceiling tiles climax in a montage of the glittering fan of a peacocks tail That image comes to mind a little later Trying to meet a potential mate in Iran must be tricky by law men and women who are not related to each other cannot socialise or touch in public and dancing because it can be interpreted as indecent is effectively banned But at Siose Pol Bridge I see a bunch of twentysomething male friends all wearing identikit skinny jeans and Bose headphones steal glances as they amble past a cluster of young women wearing high heels and pushedback headscarves The air is heavy with the whiff of Calvin Klein and Yves Saint Laurent In public women in Iran must wear headscarves We sometimes stay with local families and the custom of women wearing headscarves in their own homes varies On these occasions Suzanne the only female in our group follows the example of our hosts Women must also cover their arms and legs In cities lots of women wear brightlycoloured elegant tunics called manteaus over jeans Men meanwhile are prohibited from wearing shorts in public Its approaching sunset and along the arches of the magnoliacoloured Siose Pol Bridge couples and friends sit talk and watch a luminous salmonpink sky paint its reflection on the shimmering Zayandeh River Iran is a Muslim country but it is not Arabic Farsi is the national language and modernday Iran was once home to the ancient Achaemenid Empire at its peak it stretched from India to Ethiopia the largest empire the world has ever known The city of Persepolis was the ceremonial capital of the Achaemenid Empire Today the citys ruins a vast sandy brown terrace cut into a mountain hint at its former imperial extravagance We follow the route foreign delegations took on arrival in the city up the Grand Stairway and through the hulking pillars defended by bull sculptures of the Gate of All Nations But unlike then no trumpeters are here to greet us Looking out from the site its a jigsaw of soaring columns standing and collapsed brilliantly vivid against the sunny haze of the surrounding mountains In its pomp the grandeur of Persepolis rivalled that of Rome and Athens In fact it was Alexander the Great who in destroyed Persepolis Accounts claim that Alexander needed at least camels to cart off the citys treasures Whats most startling about Persepolis today isnt the scale but the minutiae The meticulous detail of the basreliefs expresses a fascinating story depicting the peoples of the empire including Arabs Egyptians and Ethiopians and emphasising the importance of the equinox to this culture by frequently showing a lion representing the sun killing a bull the moon The tradition continues Irans New Year starts on March Outside the perimeter of the Unesco site beside the toilets and halfhidden by pine trees we see a collection of metal frames in an abandoned field When we walk to it we realise weve stumbled into another very different chapter from Iranian history If it looks like the forgotten structures of a monumental circus in a way thats what it is In the Shah built a lavish tent city here to mark years of the Persian monarchy for over international dignitaries at a massive party Guests were served caviarstuffed quails eggs by French chefs Ironically the profligate celebrations planted the seeds of the Islamic Revolution These days its said that every Iranian home has at least two books the Quran and the collected poems of Hafez a century poet who is to Iran what Shakespeare is to England In Hafezs hometown of Shiraz his memory is fittingly marked In an extensive garden with pools and orange trees Hafezs marble tombstone rests under an imposing eightcolumned pavilion Streams of visitors swirl around the tomb yet this site possesses an innate stillness Its early evening when we get here As we sit back and watch Iranians make their pilgrimage I feel the urge for a glass of red wine But alcohol is illegal in Iran And that includes in Shiraz even though the city shares its name with one of the worlds most famous wines and its where wine was first produced more than years ago So I take a cue from Hafez His poetry celebrated the pleasures of wine but also the power of acceptance This place where you are right now Hafez wrote God circled on a map for you

And finally came the opportunity to commit to record something of the creative spark we have shared up until now What is Teacht an Fhómhair about It is ultimately a meeting of clans and ancestral forces through to people at a particular time in a particular place We discussed the idea of going out into the land and letting the music take us into a trance that brings us closer to this

45,../data/sec_IRL/Sunday Independent/Factiva-20230807-172, HARD ROAD BECKONS Rodney Edwards Wörter Februar   National    DUP ups ante over Northern Ireland Protocol Jeffrey Donaldson ousted Paul Givan at the behest of angry loyalists in a very highstakes move reports Rodney Edwards The logistics behind bringing down Northern Irelands powersharing executive were in place for almost a week Democratic Unionist leader Jeffrey Donaldson had finally made up his mind he would pull First Minister Paul Givan out of Stormont and destabilise the government in opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol knowing it would cause ripples in London Brussels and Dublin On the Friday before the announcement Donaldson drove to a community centre in Belfast and met the Loyalist Communities Council LCC a group that represents the Ulster Volunteer Force Ulster Defence Association and Red Hand Commando There he heard yet again from workingclass loyalists and those with links to paramilitaries who furiously criticised Boris Johnsons lacklustre response to their concerns over the Irish Sea border and implored him again to come good on his promise The protocol was agreed by the UK and EU to ensure free movement of trade across the land border after Brexit But unionists and loyalists such as those sitting across from Donaldson during that short meeting believe it damages Northern Irelands place in the UK A source who was at the meeting said those in attendance were getting anxious not least because they had gone to significant lengths to keep a lid on things By things he meant antiprotocol related violence which has marred Northern Ireland on and off for two years There was a strong feeling that Donaldson needed to make good on his pledges when he came into office On that Friday he was left in no doubt as to the unanimous view his threat to pull the first minister had to happen Donaldson told the group of about a dozen that if he did not see some progress from Johnson on his concerns he would take action though he told this newspaper he did not brief the loyalists on his precise plans The previous day he met senior members of the Orange Order and Brexit chief negotiator Liz Truss from Johnsons government who asked him to clarify when he needed answers on the matter The DUP leader gave her until late February but he knew he was running out of options Neither the UK prime minister nor the EU appeared to be listening to him and Foreign Minister Simon Coveney stopped phoning him months ago As for Donaldsons opponents including Sinn Féin the DUPs partners in government who had warned him not to disrupt powersharing he ignored them His mind was made up Despite assurances from Johnson that the concerns of unionists would be resolved Donaldson was not convinced and his party officers met on the evening of Friday January where they decided Givan had to go Those who knew about the decision kept it quiet over the weekend which turned out to be personally difficult for Donaldson with the death of his younger brother Andrew on the Sunday On Monday Givan who took over from ousted first minister Arlene Foster only eight months ago was told he would have to resign that Thursday However that was going to cause him problems firstly he too would have to keep the news secret not least from Sinn Féin Deputy First Minister Michelle ONeill who would also be removed from office once his resignation took effect He would also have to find a way in the next few days to clear important legislation that would not be progressed once he was out Hours after being informed of the news Givan began secretly preparing his resignation speech in which he described his short tenure as the privilege of my life He also wanted to make reference to his family wife Emma and children Annie Hollie and Masie for the sacrifices they have had to make over the past few months It is believed Givan quit the Free Presbyterian Church at the end of last year in a dispute over a service in Co Armagh to mark the centenary of Northern Ireland which President Michael D Higgins declined to attend because it was held at a Catholic church Givan also wrote about how he always wanted to do what is right for all our people a deliberate move by him to separate the role of first minister with his unionist and loyalist politics something he wanted to do while in office One Stormont source said Givan purposely left other people in his party to have a go at Sinn Féin and was sometimes frustrated by the public bunfights while he was the one sitting in a room trying to get agreement on issues such as organ donation climate change and the budget Unlike his predecessor Foster sources in the DUP and Sinn Féin say he enjoyed a good working relationship with ONeill and her party who initially thought he was simply a jumpedup bigot according to a Sinn Féin source He even had a cordial relationship with Dublin regularly phoning Micheál Martin and Coveney to discuss issues during the pandemic and expressing a desire to improve dialogue Again unlike Foster Givan wanted to speak directly to the Irish Government telling Martin and Coveney that he wanted to deal with crossborder issues before they become a problem He let Donaldson who claims the Irish Government has been dismissive of our concerns around the protocol be Donaldson Paul would tell them he wanted Belfast and Dublin to stop blindsiding each other and took the same approach when working with Sinn Féin said the source Of course Givan knew sharing responsibilities with ONeill was going to be a hard slog particularly as some of his constituents and friends had told him privately to go on the attack But he refused to get caught up in the drama knowing he would have to go the extra mile with Sinn Féin and with Stormonts civil servants For him it was trying to manage his own party and their expectations of him while also discharging his responsibilities as first minister Often policy issues would create differences a Stormont source said Not once did Paul have a row with Michelle There were times when he was tested by Sinn Féin ministers and wanted to push things to a vote and she was tested by him But he never once lost his temper It was very different to what the Executive was like when Arlene Foster was there One source close to ONeill said he would not categorise there having been a relationship What Michelle did was when there were blockages by the DUP she let the public know On several issues Michelle made it clear that it was not Sinn Féin and stripped the DUP of any cover Givan finished writing his speech on Tuesday and due to the sensitivity around what he was about to do did not allow civil servants advisers or even DUP senior members read it On Wednesday he spent all day at Parliament Buildings leafing through papers to clear things on his desk before going home The next day he was back signing off documents remotely and preparing to make his departure at Before he left in the ministerial jeep for the Crowne Plaza in central Belfast Givan submitted his letter of resignation to the Speakers Office and then phoned Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis to inform him with the Tory minister later calling on him to return to his post He also phoned ONeill telling her they would both be out of office at midnight and accepting there were items that needed to be cleared According to sources from inside both parties ONeill was disappointed by the news but accepted that Givan had tried all he could to make it work They both reflected on whether or not they could get the Executive back and thanked each other for the cooperation Paul knew what Michelle had to manage within Sinn Féin and Michelle knew what Paul was trying to do amid the DUPs internal difficulties He came into the role during serious turbulence external politics and internal party politics She gave him the space to manage that to keep the show on the road and he appreciated that At the Crowne Plaza which usually plays host to the DUPs party conferences Donaldson had already arrived He had called MLAs and MPs into a large function room downstairs to brief them MLAs including Paul Frew and MPs such as Gavin Robinson listened to the development while at the same time Givan arrived separately and was taken to another room where he would give a fourminute press conference He was given space to speak to the media on his own terms to give him his place There was no showboating with Donaldson a source said As he concluded Givan appeared emotional when referring to his family Those close to him say he was also referring albeit not directly to the pain he has felt from feeling no option but to quit his church He has also privately questioned if he could have done more to remain in the post He thanked the media there and walked out of a side door before being taken back to work to wrap up any outstanding issues The clock was ticking Downstairs the mood was just as sombre according to sources who were there with some MLAs expressing their concerns as to how the development would go down with a tired public Following developments on Twitter were ONeill and Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald who had joined the Norths Finance Minister Conor Murphy for a press conference at the Europa Hotel in the city at the very same time Givan was making his remarks ONeill wants an early election and any outstanding legislation to go through in the weeks ahead bills on organ donation welfare protection autism and integrated education are in the mix Now that she too is no longer in office Stormonts remaining ministers cannot do anything new that requires Executive agreement and are now effectively in a caretaker role We wanted to get out in advance of Givans resignation it was fairly predicted what the DUP was going to say and we wanted to be out before them to make it clear that we will not facilitate some facade as if it is business as usual a Sinn Féin source said The Sinn Féin election machine has been ready before Christmas all candidates have been selected all problems such as the issues within the party in Derry have been ironed out and all literature has been printed and ready They thought the election would come early a source said They have been wheeling out new candidates and new people have been coopted The chessboard is in place Michelle is driving and wants to be electionready when the date is set She is not the only one as the Ulster Unionists Alliance and SDLP now see the potential for an early election off the back of the DUPs gamble while the British government refuses to engage A request to interview Mr Lewis on how Johnsons government would fix the latest issue impacting AngloIrish relations was last week declined again Sam McBride Opinion page 
46,../data/sec_IRL/Sunday Independent/Factiva-20230807-172, Walking the walk in the footsteps of the saints Catherine Murphy Wörter März   National    The Camino can be a healing transformative or religious experience writes Catherine Murphy who hiked across a landscape filled with history legend culture and cuisine Covid closed the Camino a fellow pilgrim on the Camino Frances tells me Not even Spanish flu or the plague had the same impact The pandemic certainly forced the closure of churches cathedrals and albergues hostels in but as they say on the Camino ultreia et suseia onwards and upwards To compensate Holy Year has been extended to and many Camino fans will be desperately hoping to get back on the open road this spring Im ahead of the curve on a whistlestop cultural tour of the French Way which traditionally starts in St JeanPieddePort in France and travels over the Pyrenees and westwards along northern Spain to end in Santiago de Compostela Ive invested in a copy of Codex Calixtinus the medieval guide book which first popularised the route I am also expertly led through the first Spanish section of the route in the Navarra region by guide Ursula Leon and journalist Francisco Contreras Gil who has written about the magic of the Camino My first night is spent in Roncesvalles an important stop for pilgrims after a tough hike over the Pyrenees from France Id been here before but was then somehow oblivious to the tales of Charlemagnes battles the museums religious relics and the ethereal alabaster windows of the chapel As I leave behind the comfort of Hotel Roncesvalles hotelroncesvallescomhotelcom and pass the iconic to Santiago de Compostela signpost I step into a land where the ruling kings of Navarra and Aragon did battle where two ancient caminos join and where Christians and Muslims fought for religious control The Camino can be a healing transformative or religious experience for many pilgrims but its also about walking through an immense history Passing through Navarra La Rioja Castilla y León and Galicia reveals a kaleidoscope of religious art Romanesque and Gothic architecture archaeology landscapes and people from a time before Spain was Spain The biggest tip I can give to anyone thinking of walking the Camino is this it can be whatever you want it to be These days even your pooch can get their pilgrim passport stamped along the way You can travel on foot bike and horseback and you can even be pushed by wheelchair if you have a disability You can pay € a night to sleep in a parish albergue cosy up in a Tokyostyle capsule refugio or rest your tired bones in a fourstar city hotel From Roncesvalles I head to Pamplona known as the entrance to the Camino because it was the first city and home to the first cathedral that medieval pilgrims reached having crossed the border from France I arrive to find the city alive with university students enjoying juevintxos discounted pintxos served up in bars every Thursday night I stop for a coffee in Café Iruña cafeirunacom Ernest Hemingways favourite hangout during his numerous visits to the city I dip into the cathedral surprised to find a Gothic interior and magnificent cloister behind a neoclassical facade Here medieval Navarese kings stood swore oaths and were crowned Dinner is at nearby Restaurante Europa hreuropacom an elegant Michelin star restaurant run by the Idoate family where a fine dining menu costs € a bargain for Irish gourmands used to much higher prices And finally I sleep at the fourstar Hotel La Catedral pamplonacatedralhotelcom a converted convent where breakfast is served in the chapel Its proof the Camino doesnt always have to be about basic bunkbed albergues and snoring bedfellows Other accommodation highlights along the way include Hotel Real Monasterio de San Zoilo realmonasteriodesanzoilo comhotelcom in the town of Carrion de Los Condes Castilla y León and the gorgeous Boutique Hotel in Arzúa Galicia a charming oasis before the final push to Santiago de Compostela Dining highlights include O Mirador restaurant in Portomarin in Galicia where meat is cooked on an open grill by youthful twin chefs omiradorportomarincom La Droguería ladrogueriabarrestaurantecom in Puenta La Reina where local xistera sausage is one of the best eats of the trip and Mesón los Templarios in Castilla y León which serves up hearty soups and meat dishes Puenta La Reina offers a standout experience as Francisco Contreras Gil gives me a potted history of the Knights Templar the powerful order of knights and nobles that fought in the Crusades and set up what came to be known as the first banking system in the world before being disbanded in the Leaving Navarra the next stage of the French Way takes me to La Rioja home to vineyards and the shortest stretch of the Camino with just of yellowarrowed paths Its capital Logroño was the capital of the Spanish Inquisition in northern Spain its cathedral crypts feared by locals as prisoners were held there before sentencing Ahead of me in La Rioja are two of the most intensely historic towns on the French Way but first theres time for some light entertainment Travelling by taxi from Logroño to Navarette I take a gentle horse ride through vineyards then ensconce myself in wine hotel Finca de los Arandinos fincadelosarandinoscom for a relaxing massage with grape oils followed by dinner and bodega wines Churches cathedrals monasteries and old pilgrim hospitals form much of the architectural culture of the Camino and are home to works of art that deserve to be seen even by atheists like myself In Nájera a visit to the monastery of Santa Maria La Real with guide Miguel Apelaniz Ortega prompts a discussion about Spains Muslim legacy as we admire Moorish motifs similar to those found in Granadas Alhambra From Nájera I move on to Santo Domingo de la Calzada considered a jewel in the crown of the French Way with its stunning cathedral and legend of the pilgrim who was hanged Just ask about the live roosters kept in the cathedral coop and youll understand From La Rioja I cross into Castilla y León a land of shifting borders and landscapes Here Helder Cerejo a Portuguese guide Continued on next page GETTING THERE Catherine travelled as a guest of the tourist boards of Navarra visitnavarra es La Rioja lariojaturismocom Castilla y León turismocastillayleoncom and Galicia turismogal Catherine flew Dublin to Bilbao and Santiago de Compostela to Dublin with Aer Lingus which offers regular flights to both cities aerlinguscom Pilgrims usually get their Credencial at their start point But they can also get the pilgrim passport and start the Camino from St James Church on James Street in Dublin For more information caminosocietyie For other travel information try spaininfo Continued from previous page with an innate knowledge and wry perspective of the Camino takes me to the most important cities of the region and to La Meseta one of the most debated sections of the French Way Pilgrims either love or hate La Meseta With few trees and little shade on hot days many pilgrims find this region challenging It reminds me of being on a road trip in the US with huge skies and lengthy stretches of empty road Cold mornings and hot afternoons mean wheat grows here and not much else says Helder But I love the brown fields and the way that the ancient Convento de San Antón appears like a mirage offering refuge to pilgrims for a few euro a night in what seems like the middle of nowhere In Burgos I discover a crossroads between Islam and Christianity birthplace of Spanish warrior hero El Cid and home to the only UNESCOlisted cathedral in Spain Its Gothic spires dominate the city view while its massive interior houses a series of private chapels This cathedral is a monument to the wealth and ego of local merchants who wanted to be remembered via impressive tombs but it is also home to some of the most beautiful altar pieces choir stalls and works of art along the French Way Its worth taking time to sit and admire them during your visit Frómista yields a surprise a barge tour on a canal that was constructed centuries ago to transport wool wine and wheat to Santander Port The trip costs just € and no one need ever know that you skipped walking a short section of the Camino I enjoy a morning in León a city so intertwined with the Way that local girls are often named Camino Its cathedral has the second largest collection of stained glass in Europe with almost sq m and is also home to one of Gaudís early buildings a surprisingly nonArt Nouveau affair A final stop takes me from lunch in Molinaseca reputedly one of Spains most beautiful villages in the Bierzo region to Ponferrada and its magical Knights Templar castle Walking through this Templar space is a special experience I can almost see those knights with their white redcrossed mantles Then I arrive in Galicia and the final section of the route to Santiago de Compostela hiking a tough uphill path to O Cebreiro Legend has it that Charlemagne got down on his knees and prayed to God at his first sighting of green Galicia Today pilgrims stop to take milestone photos and walk on to discover a Holy Grail legend in O Cebreiros preRomanesque temple and round Palloza houses Another mustvisit along this section is the century monastery at Samos With one of the largest cloisters in Spain its a very special place to stay for a small number of lucky pilgrims who pay just € a night for the privilege The section from Sarria to Santiago de Compostela is highly popular as it allows pilgrims to walk the distance necessary to get their Compostela certificate or proof of pilgrimage Its a route that many pilgrims avoid because its so popular but dont rule it out theres much to enjoy along the way so go in May or October when its less busy Local guide Patricia Longa walks with me through forests and farmland We pass lovely riverside albergue accommodation at Ribadiso and continue on to the town of Arzúa where Hotel symbolises a new generation of accommodation along the Camino On the final morning having reached Santiago de Compostela via Monte del Gozo I head straight to the cathedral square and watch as groups of pilgrims celebrate reaching the point on the French Way Then I wander the streets and squares of one of my favourite small European cities I visit the market where chefs cook fresh seafood straight from the stall I sit in the park that overlooks the cathedral spires I go to the Convent of Santa Clara to buy Santiago tart made with almonds Its handed to me by a nun using a turn wheel I relax on the terrace of the historic parador before finishing my journey with a nighttime tour of the cathedral A restoration has uncovered ancient frescoes and aeons of religious art history a fitting end to a culturally rich Camino 
49,../data/sec_IRL/Sunday Independent/Factiva-20230807-172, IM EMBEDDED IN YOUTH CULTURE AND I REFLECT THAT IN WHAT I DO ON NATION WIDE Michelle Fleming Wörter Juli   National    At Zainab Boladale brings a fresh new perspective and social media expertise to her work on RTÉs beloved magazine show She says shes driven by a deep love of telling stories and in staying true to her quirky personality S he missed the memo when fresh out of college Zainab Boladale turned up at an audition for RTÉ childrens news show wearing trainers jeans and a Penneys top with her hair in coloured braids Her talent shone through all the same and this little Clare girl landed the gig Five years on and today Boladale is injecting the cool into Nationwide with her zeitgeisty reporting style and turning the TikTok generation on to the TV show their grannies love As it turned out her joining the Nationwide team in proved a timely coup for the national broadcaster When pandemic restrictions scuppered the magazine programmes usual recording setups a few months later socialmedia savvy Boladale gave the traditional Nationwide format a modern twist Digging up stories online she created packages with footage from sharing platforms such as Instagram and TikTok A lot of my stories are TikTok or social mediabased and people my age are videoediting and savvy already so I knew I could easily mix those clips in with our footage the says about how she navigated the challenge of producing shows during lockdown Like the Gardiner brothers from Clarinbridge who were touring with Riverdance and who came home during Covid I saw their viral TikTok videos All we had to do was the interview out in gorgeous Galway and splice the amazing footage they had from all over the world I loved meeting Ruth Codd from Wexford who makes cool videos Shes an amputee her videos had followers She got a role in The Midnight Club a Netflix show in the States Its so interesting to do shows of amazing young people and see how far they go so quickly Were chatting today over mochas in a seaside coffee house in Dublin where the deliberately muted decor doesnt know what its missing until Boladale strolls in wearing a tangerine summer dress and the sun comes out As well as being the first African Irish journalist to join our national broadcaster Boladale moved to Clare from Nigeria when she was four she was also the youngest journalist in the RTÉ newsroom when she was signed up to present at the age of And shes definitely the youngest on Nationwides team Boladales distinctly cool Instagram reels and TikTok videos where she likes to unwind flitting between rapping to Nicki Minaj lipsyncing to Burna Boy and shooting makeup videos buzz with fresh fun content typical of any bubbly twentysomething At first glance its a sassy persona that doesnt jump out as a natural match for Nationwide an RTÉ institution with a format thats barely changed since your mammy was a girl Boladale begs to differ It may seem like were opposites but my editor Eoin Ryan at Nationwide is so open to different ideas so a lot of the quirky stuffI find can slot in there where it wouldnt necessarily work on other current affairs shows A good story is a good story if it clicks it clicks I brought the social media element as thats what I see out there Im seeing a younger Ireland and Im embedded in youth culture and I reflect that in what I do I spend a lot of time online anyway so it doesnt feel like research She admits that not all of the programmes content falls within her comfort zone I wouldnt know the first thing about agriculture and those stories wouldnt be on my radar But like any good journalist she dives into unfamiliar territory with gusto I did a story about a new type of Korean farming a guy picked up while living in Asia I told the guy straight I know nothing about farming but that allowed me to explain it simply to viewers I dont pretend I know if I dont As journalists were always learning and at the core its about being a good communicator being the vehicle for the story Unlike a lot of schoolchildren today who see a career in the public eye as both desirable and obtainable Boladale never dreamed of being a YouTube or TV darling However as a bookish teenager she pinpointed her dream career in journalism early on My mom was saying you can be a lawyer or do medicine its a Nigerian thing so I thought Id better decide before Im pushed into something she laughs Im the first born and my mother came here for a better education for us so theres a lot of layers School lessons were always very important to my parents more in that we do something useful for society My mother was a nurse in Nigeria and is a carer here If I was struggling my mom got me grinds even if money was tight I was always very busy reading and wanted to be an author to tell stories I was nerdy I love scifi horror and gritty stuff I watched Dr Who Buffy The Vampire Slayer Twilight I wanted to be a features writer Journalism settled in my mind at or Boladale was four when she moved from Lagos Nigeria to Ennis with her mother Sally brother Giyaath now and sister Zarena who is now and an IADT business student Her father a businessman is still in Lagos but theyre close she visited Nigeria for the first time in years in There was pressure to achieve there but Ive always felt I need to push myself and do what I want to do on my terms This determination served her well when her aspirations were questioned A family member said media was too risky as a career choice for me as there werent Black people working in Irish media I understand where they were coming from and journalism is a risky career anyway Its competitive and its tough to get a stable income but I was determined to try If it didnt work out I could do something else She was still at primary in Scoil Chríost Rí when her teacher Joe Garry spotted her aptitude for languages I had Mr Garry for three years and he noticed I picked up Irish well and told my mom Id get more points if I went to an Irishspeaking secondary school I speak Yoruba because when I left Nigeria at four my Nanny Amina didnt speak English My family is Muslim so I speak a bit of Arabic I think Irish stuck as I was already thinking in two languages Boladales mother Sally jumped on Mr Garrys advice and despite her daughters protests sent her to Gaelcholáiste An Chláir in Ennis Everyone else came from solid Gaelic backgrounds and I was the only one It was difficult I couldnt talk back unless it was in Irish I left in third year because by then I knew I wanted to focus on English and journalism She finished her education in an Englishspeaking school but those three years have stood her in good stead She enjoys chatting as Gaeilge and knitting Irish into stories if they call for it My Irish is very conversational and colloquial Ive done some Nationwide stories through Irish When Bláthnaid Ní Chofaigh started on Nationwide she used to talk a lot to me in Irish Just chitchats relaxed and colloquial It comes in handy Culture is important to the family Boladale performs her poetry at international competitions However there are limits to her talents she says with a laugh I wish I was blessed with musical talent That skipped me my brother plays the banjo and my sister plays the concertina in trad bands in Clare I couldnt even master the tin whistle Boladale went on to study journalism at DCU In she was named journalist of the year at the universitys hybrid awards I thought It just has to work out I wanted to prove I didnt make the wrong choice and I could be independent One summer in Ennis I asked the Clare People if I could come in and they let me do the news in briefs and I saw how a newsroom runs It was so eyeopening That gave me confidence and Id email local magazines longform features was what I wanted to do most would say no and wouldnt pay but I kept at it I just wanted a byline somewhere The Irish Independent picked » » up a feature story I wrote about the unglamorous life of an international student about a Brazilian friend of mine I was so proud of that Im a quirky person so I got stuffinto student website campusie about music and TV I wrote about the legacy of Prince at the time he died and about Afrobeat Ive got a lot of interests and Im observant so I pick up whats going on I never thought about TV I didnt see it for me I was chatty but I saw people on TV with big bold personas and although Im confident I didnt feel like I was serious enough Im quite laidback Not too laidback though She first threw her cap in for while a secondyear student RTÉ kept her CV on file and when she graduated by which time she was freelancing for the Irish Independent and temping the broadcaster invited her for an audition Id decided I was not going home to Ennis so something had to work out I needed to make rent and make Dublin stick After my audition with RTÉ they called me in and I thought it was for some other work They told me I was natural on camera they liked my energy and I had the job I said Are you sure I rang my mom and she was so joyous praising God Starting on was a baptism of fire for Boladale whod just turned and had never done live broadcasting I felt imposter syndrome going straight into live TV I was the youngest person in the newsroom and everyone had so much experience I did some training but it was hugely nervewracking My editors Avril Hoare and AnneMarie Smyth were very nurturing giving me advice telling me You got this Even when I made blips theyd say Chill out Tomorrow is another day I loved and it was a foundation Im so grateful for If you cant explain something to kids youve no business explaining things to adults It was intense trying to convey issues like the Trump elections Black Lives Matter elections in Ireland to get it down to the facts for children in a way they understand its a huge responsibility Its one of the best training experiences in the newsroom but Im biased she concludes smiling However her newsroom baptism of fire also came with trials outside the office that most journalists never have to confront She wasnt long on TV when racist trolls set up YouTube accounts where they posted clips from her screen work along with disgusting comments I sat with it for so long and then got so fed up Aged she took a stand writing a Twitter post that ignited a national conversation and spurred RTÉ into calling on social media platforms to stamp out racism I think it was important writing about my experiences mostly because it made a stand that racism wont be appreciated or accepted Its just like if youre a female journalist you need to sometimes make a stand that sexism wont be accepted I was a guinea pig in terms of being a journalist receiving the racist abuse online Im not a victim but I was young the first person who looked like me on screen this little Clare girl who came from nowhere so the poking and prodding trolls online felt I was an easy target I was a bit freaked out that her post went viral but it turned out to be very impactful People shouldnt have to deal with these things I wish I wasnt the guinea pig having to talk about my experiences while being a journalist but some things happen for a reason I realised early you dont have to tolerate nonsense just because youre out there as part of your job She adds I would never write anything I wouldnt stand by there were times I questioned myself Im very considerate about what words do and wont put words out there that I havent thought about I know words have impact and they last Thankfully even three years ago can seem like a faraway country Im definitely seeing so much more representation Ireland is so much more openly visually inclusive The music and

towards normalisation that this is part of everyday life and just what young Ireland looks like I never define myself as being the first Black journalist on RTÉ I just see myself as someone who had a passion for journalism and pursued it and thankfully Im lucky to have landed where I have I want what I do to be appreciated not what I look like or represent I want my work to be the focus During summer when was on a break with schools off Boladale found a new focus when she asked the Nationwide team if she could help out They sent me on a story to Limerick about Avril Riordan who has fibromyalgia and makes beautiful keepsakes like teddy bears or quilts from the clothing of loved ones whove passed on It was a great first story as it had a lot of complex layers and had a lot of emotion They put it out and it was my longestform feature I was thrilled And Nationwide kept a hold of her ever since So whats next on her agenda Does Claire Byrnes recently vacated chair look like it could be comfy Or maybe Ryan Tubridys Late Late Show recliner Id love to keep doing longform pieces like fringe documentaries that are quirky and upbeat Louis Theroux style Oh yes Hard news wouldnt suit my personality She pauses to ponder The Late Late Show While the Late Late would be such an outstanding honour if I was ever given the opportunity I think Id be more suited to hosting a show that breaks traditional television formats For people my age realness and rawness is really appreciated being authentically yourself not glamorising an image I think a show that allows me to be cheeky and unfiltered GenZ With Zainab has a ring to it Get on it RTÉ l Zainab is hosting a TV presenting workshop for to in Dublin on July See cinemagicie My mom was saying you can be a lawyer or do medicine

53,../data/sec_IRL/Sunday Independent/Factiva-20230807-172, SOULMATE WANTED Liadán Hynes Wörter Oktober   National    RESTRICTIONSAPPLY For almost two years Liadán Hynes travelled to farms villages and remote islands throughout the country to write a book about dating in rural areas Here she reveals what she discovered about finding love outside the big smoke from niche apps and speeddating in Carlow to complicated logistics and the way this can mean a hard choice between place and person S he wasnt long into online dating when Vicki realised that she needed something more specific than what was on offer from Tinder Plenty of Fish and Bumble the three dating apps she tried Since she was a small child Vicki had loved horses and the childhood hobby had blossomed into a life built around the outdoors and animals She had studied equine training and management in college and as an adult carved out a career working with animals Now she found herself talking to people who never in a million years would you think about meeting in real life For Vicki as for many of the people I spoke to for my new book Courting Tractor Dates Macra Babies And Swiping Right In Rural Ireland what she did as a job felt like far more than an office job from which she switched offat the end of the day In fact many of the people I talked to described their chosen career in vocational terms It was a way of life And in a partner they needed someone who shared their appreciation for and understanding of this exact way of life whether that was a knowledge of the demands running a farm can place upon a persons time or the pace of life offered by living in a small community on an island or the immersion in nature moving out of a city might offer My lifestyle didnt really fit with a normal persons lifestyle someone who did a ninetofive job in an office Vicki told me of her time on the more mainstream dating apps I didnt have enough in common with the people I was meeting When she would describe the events of her day things like staying late with a sick animal to wait for the vet they would look at her blankly Why was she not going home at five oclock So Vicki turned to muddymatchescouk a dating website set up by British sisters Lucy Rand and Emma Royall Established in when online dating was in its nascent stage and actual dating apps were yet to be invented People were starting to talk about it in London Unfortunately it was kind of seen as freaks and weirdos or people who were a bit desperate Lucy told me It is whats known in the world of dating as a niche dating site It was something of an early adopter nowadays Muddy Matches is far from being the only one of its kind to offer people a more specific pool of potential matches Name a preference a way of life a proclivity or taste and chances are there is a dating app to provide fellow fans Theres Cougar for mature women Fitafy meet active singles and friends who value health and fitness Frolo for single parents Outdoor Lads Trek Dating Kippo the dating app for gamers Muzmatch for Muslim and Arab singles dating and marriage Theres also Christian Dating Ireland calling all single Christians Veggly for vegan and vegetarian daters Kink D BDSM fetish dating Stache Passions for moustache lovers Redhead Dates youre sure to find your ginger flame Dead Meet for those who work in the death industry Bristlr for beard lovers Tastebuds which pairs people in accordance with their musical preferences and Gluten Free Singles to name but a few Pet lovers nondrinkers sailors astrologers clowns all have their specific dating apps which will help you find someone into the same things as you At the most exclusive end of the market are the invitationonly dating apps Raya often referred to as Tinder for celebrities or The League Are you often told your standards are too high Keep them that way The League a community designed for the overly ambitious Back in Rand was living in London and her sister Emma who still lived in the countryside where they had grown up on a farm was visiting for the weekend Over drinks in the pub Emma confided in Lucy about the difficulty of meeting someone when you lived in a rural area Had she tried online dating Lucy wondered She had but it was full of townies Both sisters immediately realised the problem They knew that coming from a rural background could predispose a person towards priorities around how they wished to live Priorities which someone who grew up in an urban location might not understand » » We just kind of figured that everyone knew that that was a thing it was a niche Lucy told me Surely there must be something specifically aimed at people living in the countryside they thought There wasnt or rather barely the sisters did find an equestrianrelated dating site and a matchmaking site which required a large fee in return for organising only a couple of dates Lucy and Emma knew there was a gap Space for something that was a bit of fun aimed at people who shared a love of the countryside and a genuine understanding of what was involved in a life there rather than a kind of idyllic fantasy Farmers have to cancel dates because theyve got trespassers or cows in a ditch You cant just stop that its a way of life it totally takes over Youre always going to put the animals first and the farm They never imagined it would be a fulltime career but they decided to have a bash at it In fact they were on to something Muddy Matches is now years in business Their oldest Muddy Matches baby born to a couple who met on the site is now Muddy Matches isnt itself yet an app theyre a small familyrun business and these things take time Lucy explained with a grin Not long after they launched the pair began receiving messages from Ireland When were they planning to launch here They werent but in the face of customer demand decided to In they held a speeddating event in Co Carlow With a smile Lucy described to me sitting in a cafe the following morning listening to the fellow customers all unaware of who they were It was the chat of the place she said They didnt realise we were the Muddy Matchers It was Shock horror theres been a speeddating event At that first event in Borris most attendees were between and Proper farming community proper rural people came to that Lucy said They had chosen Borris because it was one of the top bachelor hotspots in Ireland according to the Census As it turned out the event was a huge success The sisters had tapped into something A want in people for a person who understood them who understood where they were coming from or going to blowins who wanted the same kind of life You dont have to live in the countryside to be muddy Lucy says describing something that is a combination of lived experience and genuine understanding of what is involved They have members who are currently living in a rural setting but also those who had to leave younger siblings who didnt inherit the farm but long to get back to that way of life And there are those who grew up in an urban setting but who do truly understand what it is like to live outside of a large city Last July The Wall Street Journal ran an article Looking for love post lockdown Niche dating apps are the next big thing It pointed out that we all had a lot of time during lockdowns to think about what kind of lives we wanted to live and daters were now much clearer on the kind of person they wanted to meet The niche dating apps offer the hope of some kind of shortcut to hopefully finding someone in the often daunting landscape of online dating with whom you have something in common Someone who wants to live in a similar way to you What did you learn about dating in rural Ireland is one of the most common questions people ask when I tell them Ive written Courting The starting point was all of the above the logistics and technicalities of it How do apps work when you live in a smaller community Do you start to bump into people online who you went to school with as you run through everyone available Yes as it turns out but thats not really a problem because as anyone who is single knows online dating is now the main way of meeting someone There isnt the embarrassment around it thats sometimes imagined by those who met their partners years ago this set tend to recoil in horror at the idea of online dating while those who engage in it tend to talk in tones of grim determination I went back on the apps said in somewhat resigned tones was the phrase I heard most regularly in speaking to people for the book As I set out on what would become almost two years of research travelling to farms islands villages and small towns throughout the country I wondered whether when you live in more isolated smaller communities you are forced to throw your distance preferences wide open Do sparsely populated places equal less choice which in turn equals the assumption of meeting someone who does not live close by in your community Also yes Almost everyone I spoke to had a builtin expectation that if they met someone there was a good chance they were unlikely to live near them It taught me to stop bemoaning my own longdistance relationship much of this book was written on the train from Dublin to Cork on the way to see my boyfriend The likelihood of meeting someone who did not live near you was assumed as a possibility When this happened it could range from a pain in the neck to far a more complicated situation if things like farm ownership was involved What if both people were in agriculture both inheriting the family farm Who would move But fairly soon the more people I spoke to matters beyond the logistical were what struck me It became clear that for many people there was a tension between their place and their person the meeting of one that is These people had stayed where they grew up moved as an adult or returned home having lived away to a place that offered them a specific way of life to which they had a huge affinity They felt that place was essential to their wellbeing their ability to live a » » happy life But often being in this place limited or maybe even precluded their chances of meeting a romantic partner There was the woman I spoke to in her who grew up in Dublin but moved to a small island community of a couple of hundred people She had visited somewhere similar decades before and always wanted to experience island life She adapted immediately loved it had no issue with the long sometimes lonely winters However she knew that living there meant it was many many times harder for her to meet someone than it would have been had she remained in Dublin It also made it far more likely that she a single woman could afford to live on her own than had she remained in the city where she was born she pointed out There was the farmer in his who told me of past dates where it might seem to be going somewhere but then an intense work period would begin and his partner could not understand why he would be unavailable for several weeks His current girlfriend comes from farming so she understands There was the man living in Co Down who told me Dating apps only work if you live in a city He was back living at home having returned from London after a divorce and to see out the pandemic And he loved it relished being by the sea near his family the beauty of the place where he had grown up the community there He was buying a house there But the logistics of dating people who did not live nearby were challenging Place versus person It came up again and again The meanings of their place were manifold everything from the way of life it offered to the community family connections and sense of a balanced life And as for Vicki She was born in Essex and working in England when she first signed up for Muddy Matches having come across the site through an ad on Facebook It piqued my interest an online dating website specifically for farmersslashoutdoorsy people she told me Initially the subscription fee put her off a qualm that was soon quashed after some more time spent on other apps She joined and within three days had met Stephen a farmer from Cork who was living at the time in England where he was working on a farm They have since moved to Cork where they now live in an apartment built into his parents home and work in farming both on the family farm and elsewhere She has two dogs and two horses Stephen and myself are incredibly different people but the thing that we have in common is the love for farming and the outdoors and animals Vicki says And that is more important I would much rather have someone who is different than me but who gets the lifestyle than have someone who has all the exact same hobbies and interests as me but doesnt like farming and animals Vicki and Stephen are now engaged l My lifestyle didnt really fit with a normal persons lifestyle someone who did a ninetofive job in an office I didnt have enough in common with the people I was meeting Farmers have to cancel dates because theyve got trespassers or cows in a ditch You cant just stop that its a way of life it totally takes over Youre always going to put the animals first and the farm I would much rather have someone who is different than me but who gets the lifestyle than have someone who has all the exact same hobbies and

States but the arrival of her two boys and the go for it culture in New York combined to enable her to turn a hobby into a thriving business The century American comedian WC Fields said many cantankerous things including I am free of all prejudice I hate everyone equally and start every day offwith a smile and get it over with but his enduring curmudgeonly advice was never to work with animals or children Numerous stars including Emma Thompson and Colin Farrell have since disagreed with the comedians dislike of children and animals as coworkers but it has to be said most actors only occasionally have to work with kids It is however a large part of Aoife Reddans workload New Yorkbased Aoife is a family photographer capturing magic moments and milestones of childrens lives for their doting parents and for posterity Its easier to work with other peoples children than your own the mother of two says with a laugh adding Its generally the dads who hate posing the most Family is very important to the warmhearted Aoife Not only the family she and her husband Cian are creating together but her extended family My greatgrandfather was Cathal Brugha Aoife who was a Ní Bhriain before she married notes with pride namechecking the man who was one of the heroes of and a member of the first Dáil Im not a big history buffand one teacher at school did give me a hard time for not knowing more but it was a big part of our family lore growing up My granny Noinín was his daughter She would have grown up with the Black and Tans invading her home and she was sent to Coláiste na Rinne the Irishspeaking boarding school in Waterford when she was young to hide from the Black and Tans She used to speak Irish a lot and we all ended up doing a year in Ring too Aoife recalls My dad still attends all the commemoration ceremonies and my brother Gearóid who flies the government jet has a lot of involvement My boys Jack and Harry have dual citizenship and I like to tell them about our history theyre at the ages six and four where they are beginning to understand Aoifes own parents both worked in caring professions and they met on a training programme before going on different aid missions My dad was going to Bangladesh and my mum who was a nurse and midwife was going to Kenya They reconnected after they came back They were both dedicated to helping people I remember my dad went to Kosovo and Rwanda with Concern so thats what I would have grown up with Aoife who grew up in Rathdrum Co Wicklow is the eldest of four Her other brothers are Diarmuid an engineer and Aengus a primary teacher After finishing school she went to UCD where she studied sociology and economics I was always very creative and I did think of studying art but I suppose I went for something more reliable I went for the safe option Immediately after leaving college she got a job in marketing and loved it I did get to be creative organising campaigns and the art materials for the campaigns The economics side came in when I was doing budgets and getting conferences together Around the same time in she met Cian who lived in London I went to London for a weekend to meet friends who had moved over and met Cian in an Irish bar We ended up doing twoandahalf years long distance he was in London and I was in Dublin He worked in Lehman Brothers then Lehman fell apart He ended up not losing his job as PwC took over then a Japanese bank Nomura bought the division of Lehman brothers which Cian worked in and hes been with them ever since » » Aoife moved to London in and got a job as brand manager with Power Plate A yearandahalf later the couple moved to Hong Kong where both continued in their respective fields and Aoife went to work with Red Bull I covered brand marketing for Red Bull for Hong Kong Taiwan and Macau I was travelling a lot and we did a lot of our own travel We went to the Philippines and to Australia as my brother Diarmuid was there for a while Aoife loved Hong Kong and it was there she discovered her talent for photography Most of the people I worked with were from Hong Kong and I learned Cantonese she says For brand marketing I had to learn about the people and their lives so we really submerged ourselves in the culture there Theyre very polite people very respectful Were still friends with a lot of the people I worked with We had a really good expat community too There was a rugby club there and every weekend when Cian was playing rugby Id go into the heart of Hong Kong and take photographs It was an amazing experience and we loved it she adds My parents and brothers came to visit and Cians dad who sadly died six months ago came a lot Cians brother Eoin is a rugby player and their dad would go to the Lions tour and the World Cup and stop offand visit us on the way However despite all the visitors it is far from home So when Cian got an opportunity to transfer to New York they jumped at it He is managing director of technology at Nomura running the IT systems and leading a team of worldwide They got married in Ireland in and moved immediately The only problem was Aoifes marketing career I had to decide what to do with my life I could have gone into marketing in the States but it would probably have involved starting all over again as an intern Cian knew I had left numerous jobs to follow him so he was like why dont you do something that youd really love so I decided to pursue photography She did an intensive course at New York Film Academy and began to get work immediately after People in NY especially are so enthusiastic and supportive You tell someone youre a photographer and theyre like Let me put you in touch with this person and this person which I dont think is as easy at home So I started getting jobs I did some interiors work and also worked with clothing brands like Hunter boots When the boys came along Aoife found it wasnt as easy to be available for the interiors and fashion work But a new type of photography started to emerge for her Having kids and making friends who had kids I fell into the world of family photography There are three strands to the work parents like to get professional photos when they have a newborn but the main work is with slightly older kids Then theres the holiday card photo every family gets an annual photo taken which they then send as their Christmas card to their nearest and dearest While WC Fields dictum may have been a bit over the top working with kids is not considered tricky without reason they have notoriously short attention spans so Aoife has to work quickly But she says she never has a problem I have a lot of tricks I get them to play games or maybe get them to tickle the mom on the nose or chin If theres more than one child I get them to whisper to each other and theyll start laughing about the things theyre whispering usually naughty things I pull out the playfulness in them she explains The work fits in well with her own family life she photographs newborns during the week and older children at weekends and she does the postshoot editing when her own kids are at school Aoife loves living in New York and has done since the beginning though she says it was scary when first hit It was horrific New York was one of the hardest places to be We were cooped up in the apartment for four months nonstop There were ambulances and curfews and riots People were saying the bridges are closing the tunnels are closing if you dont leave youll be trapped in the city and people panicked and left This building had like occupancy during We stayed Jack was three and Harry was oneandahalf It was hard she notes adding with a laugh When we came out of that time we were like were leaving but then everyone came back New York is back When they first came to New York they rented in the West Village as Aoife wanted the New York redbrick building experience The first year we were here it was the coldest winter We had just come from Hong Kong and had no winter gear It was so cold we went to stay with friends wed just met Then when we came back to our apartment the pipes had burst It was miserable Then we moved down here Down here is a lovely threebedroom apartment on the ninth floor of a modern building in south Battery Park City Every area is very different This area is very family oriented And there are a lot of businesses Goldman Sachs is here Amex is here and Freedom Tower nearby has lots of businesses The West Village is very cool and there are a lot of really nice restaurants Soho is shopping and lovely apartments and the East Village is students NYU is there They recently got their citizenship which was very important to them after the Covid experience We could fly to Ireland and come back as we had the Green Card but because of travel restrictions imposed in the US when Covid hit our parents couldnt fly to us My mum would normally come every six months but because of we didnt see them for two years After we said we never wanted a border separating us The boys are citizens and now we are too They go home every year and will continue to do so but they have an extra family treat in store in the next few weeks Aoifes two brothers Diarmuid and Gearóid are taking part in the Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge Starting from the Canaries they will row to Antigua Each one will row for two hours then sleep for two hours then row again for two hours It will be exhausting and will take six weeks Theyre doing it for the RNLI and Laura Lynn she says of the continuing family tradition of altruism We plan to track their journey and meet them in Antigua While Aoife loves to see family she is very happy living in New York Everyone is from somewhere else which is lovely In the boys schools there is such an interesting mix of friends there are Canadian Korean Egyptian Indian and they celebrate all the holidays Christian holidays Muslim Jewish next year theyre bringing in Diwali so they get to experience all these lovely traditions One American tradition Aoife has embraced is the holiday card and she made a point of having a big family photo taken when they all went home in the summer With her own kids involved that was one she was happy to outsource See areddancom I have a lot of tricks If theres more than one child I get them to whisper to each other and theyll start

61,../data/sec_IRL/Irish News/Factiva-20230807-170,Churches must show more generosity’ during crisis Wörter April The Irish  IRISHN  c The Irish  Ltd All Rights reserved NOONE in the congregation in Belfast’s St Anne’s Cathedral on January could have imagined that within two months our normal way of life would be turned so dramatically upside down That Saturday the cathedral was playing host to the consecration of the Reverend David McClay as the Church of Ireland Bishop of Down and Dromore Back then in what already feels like a lifetime ago was something happening on the other side of the world in a Chinese city most of us had never heard of But today we all know about the coronavirus and the deadly reach of its invisible shadow Its arrival in Ireland has closed schools and businesses brought lockdown and isolation and completely transformed the health and social care service No facet of life is untouched by the imperative to combat the virus slow its spread and care for those affected Coronavirus has also forced churches to close their doors meaning that for people of faith this has been an Easter like no other Marking Holy Week and celebrating the death and resurrection of Jesus the high point of the Christian calendar in traditional ways was impossible Churches have responded to the new dispensation by moving online with impressive alacrity imagination and creativity while continuing to support the most vulnerable through food banks and other practical means The previous years of the new bishop’s service were spent in coalface ministry in the innercity Belfast parish of Willowfield Prior to that the Ballyshannon native was a curate in Magheralin and rector in Kilkeel He says his priorities as bishop include ensuring that the Scriptures are taught and proclaimed in ways that make God’s word relevant to a postmodern world and evangelism so that the Church effectively reaches people beyond our walls to become disciples of Jesus Christ That outward opendoor approach helps explain why he instinctively found it really difficult to think about even the possibility of churches having to close when coronavirus arrived It went against the way I’ve done church’ for years but it quickly became clear that it was not only what I had to do but it was the right thing to do he says I asked clergy to be creative around doing services says Bishop McClay adding that online church services’ should make sure that the Bible is taught and preached that there is prayer and some way for people to connect with God in worship The response has been phenomenal he says echoing comments by other Church leaders including the Catholic Archbishop of Armagh Eamon Martin who has paid tribute to all those taking advantage of the opportunities offered by the digital highways Week by week and daily there are services and the preaching of the word of God and opportunities for worship going out from our churches says Bishop McClay St Patrick’s Day with churches on the cusp of closure was the last time he was in a large gathering of any sort The following Sunday there were three of us in Down Cathedral Now he is only going to churches where I can walk to from his home on the outskirts of east Belfast This has included praying for all the vacant churches in our diocese from the car park of Knocknagoney parish and recording a sermon in Holywood parish For Good Friday he recorded a Tenebrae’ in Knocknagoney a service that captures the drama of the Passion narrative as candles are lit and extinguished to reflect Christ’s journey to the cross Funerals are where the emotional costs of the coronavirus restrictions are perhaps at their highest Whether held in a church or at a graveside public health guidance is that funerals should be attended by only the very smallest handful of sociallydistanced mourners The Methodist Church has stopped offering church funerals altogether as have the Catholic dioceses of Down and Connor and Clogher Bishop McClay says he is encouraging clergy to talk it through in a sensitive pastoral way with families and to try to hold something around the graveside We haven’t said a blanket no’ to funerals in churches but actually it’s easier for families and everybody if we can point them to the graveside says Bishop McClay We have to think beyond buildings buildings are probably the least safe place for a mixed group of people Memorial services and what he calls bereavement evenings’ can happen when the current crisis has passed he hopes Bishop McClay believes that prayer and fasting ought to be normal for Christians in the midst of the pandemic but there must also be more generosity Christians need to be the most generous people in our society in how we deal with our employees for example and find ways to give he says The Church can often ignore need or pretend it’s not there we need to go and look for it Families are struggling In these days of lockdown and increased isolation in the face of a deadly threat many people are asking why God would allow something like to exist It’s a very contemporary version of the problem of pain question that has vexed theologians and philosophers for millennia God didn’t cause the coronavirus explains Bishop McClay We live in a fallen sinful world where lots of painful things happen There’s lot of painful things happening right now that are in no way related to coronavirus Where is God My answer to that is always quite straightforward God is where he always is God is near to those who cry out to him The Church and Christian people need to cry out for those who cannot cry out for themselves This is what Easter is really about he says The cross is all about a God who knows us loves us cares for us and died for us but he rose again and defeated coronavirus and sickness and death and hell itself Bishop McClay says

congregations will be smaller thanks to social distancing measures and caps on the numbers who can be safely accommodated in a church building They’ll be quieter too Congregational singing has been generally discouraged since churches were allowed to reopen in the summer in the wake of the spring lockdown Carols are a muchloved Christmas highlight for many but where they do happen they’ll be

available over webcam and we strongly encourage families to tune in’ from the domestic churches’ of their living rooms and join with those who are gathering in their local churches in welcoming the birth of the Christchild The Church has developed resources to support online Advent and Christmas worship The season of Christmas is a season of celebration but this year it is essential that we celebrate safely Fr Eddie McGee spokesman for the Diocese of Down and Connor said Its measures are typical of those being taken across Ireland Normally at Christmas time large numbers of people wish to attend Mass he added This year however due to the pandemic our churches simply cannot accommodate such crowds if we are to ensure the health and safety of all and conform to Public Health Agency guidance and NI Executive legislation Down and Connor is holding some public Masses throughout the diocese with restricted numbers following social distancing measures and places booked in advance It is however likely that most parishioners and families will celebrate Christmas Mass at home joining their local parish via online streaming services such as webcam Fr McGee said This approach is being adopted across Ireland with details of which parishes are celebrated public Mass and which are online available on diocesan websites Parishes have shown remarkable imagination in their Christmas events One of the most inventive was on Friday evening when the Church of Ireland parishes of Trory and Killadeas in Fermanagh held a drivein Carols by Runway Lights’ concert St Michael’s Trory is situated at the end of the runway of St Angelo airport which is also the site of a Covid testing centre A programme of music interspersed with bible readings was broadcast to up to people parked on

Primary School in the city on Christmas Eve These will be something to make this a Christmas to remember parish administrator Fr Peter McAnenly said It will be completely safe because people must remain in their cars he said We’re encourage all families and young people in our parish to attend the drivein Masses The Cathedral will be also hosting an online A Family Christmas’ event tomorrow from It will be led by Archbishop Eamon Martin with Karl McGuckin Eilis Fox and Malachi Cush A similar event earlier this year was watched by more than people another example of how in forcing change

Irish InterChurch Committee members reflected on Something Other than a Building the recent publication by Dr Gladys Ganiel of Queen’s University Belfast Based on interviews with faith leaders it captured significant aspects of the experience of living with as faith communities The findings of this report encourage and challenge us in equal measure The report demonstrates the commitment of the local church to the holistic care of our communities responding to people’s spiritual and emotional needs as well as providing other forms of support and care through social and charitable outreach Under very difficult circumstances churches have found creative ways to give expression to Christ’s commandment to love of neighbour It has been understood too that in the context of a pandemic living out this commandment is also about the sacrifices we choose to make for the common good We greatly miss coming together in community for public worship but appreciate the importance of supporting the stay at home’ message from government in both jurisdictions on the island in light of the very clear evidence that this will make a real difference to the protection of the most vulnerable At the same time we have been liaising with political leaders to ensure that the spiritual dimension of health and wellbeing is not overlooked as we plan for recovery A particularly poignant section of Dr Ganiel’s report is the discussion of the area of bereavement where clergy have spoken of their pain at seeing people isolated in their grief deprived of much of the contact that brings comfort at these times has traumatised our society and we will be dealing with the consequences of this for some time to come In the Irish InterChurch Meeting we are conscious of our responsibility to support clergy in responding to this need We have been very grateful for the support of funeral directors who have been working in very difficult circumstances and we have deeply appreciated the sensitivity shown by those tasked with making policy in this area Together we can help ensure that those who have been bereaved and those working to support them are not forgotten in the midst of a desire to return to normality’ It was Jesus Christ who instructed His followers to heal the sick and inspired a Christian tradition of involvement in health care For clergy the health message of keeping our distance’ has also brought challenges to managing pastoral care This is especially true where they are unable to be in close contact with people who are dealing with difficult issues such as sickness loneliness mental illhealth and financial pressures The frustration felt by some clergy has been detrimental to their own health and we have sought to remind those in pastoral leadership of the importance of selfcare and selfcompassion As a society it is important we do not take our carers for granted whether they are formally employed in a caring profession like our healthcare workers who are giving so much of themselves or providing care in the home for family members One of the positives that has produced is that in many areas we have discovered a new sense of neighbourliness It has been so encouraging to see how the community has come together in care and helpfulness as people have reached across various divides to meet someone else’s need Christians will be reminded of Christ’s example of the Good Samaritan Luke The response to the question Who is my neighbour’ is simply the one who showed mercy Above and beyond race ethnicity religion or politics or any of the other categories that separate on the basis of identity what binds us together is basic human compassion This speaks powerfully to a society that is fractured and fracturing in many ways at a time when we most need to pull together If we are to heal our common life we need to resist being captive to our own agendas and see each other through God’s eyes building relationships of compassion and support as we love our neighbour the Jesus way Dr Ganiel’s research has highlighted the fact that during the pandemic there has been greater visibility of interchurch cooperation particularly at leadership level and this has been a great encouragement to many We draw strength from solidarity and coming together and share our burdens We are conscious too of our responsibility as civic leaders to support and encourage our political leaders in the difficult choices they face on our path to recovery as we seek to ensure that policy decisions are in line with principles of social justice protecting social cohesion and the common good As people of faith we endeavour to bring a muchneeded message of hope to a society struggling with prolonged uncertainty We do so without minimising the reality of the suffering endured by so many or the very real challenges ahead We pray that those who are struggling will know Christ’s love and protection and see these reflected in the care and compassion of their neighbours n Rev Dr Ivan Patterson is President of the Irish Council of Churches He is a former Moderator of the Presbyterian Church The ICC was founded in in the aftermath of the civil war and

situations where on the face of it things are falling apart they aren’t actually falling apart they are still under God’s control and certainly as Christians we should be taking heart from that After almost months of Covid restrictions Tom Clarke is relieved that Bangor Worldwide Missionary Convention can go ahead as planned The annual convention is celebrating its anniversary this year The missionary event has run every year since although talks and meetings had to go online last year due to Covid rules We were quite determined to do whatever we could this year Mr Clarke said Starting tomorrow this year’s convention will focus on the persecution of Christians around the world Mr Clarke said in some countries where Christianity is a minority religion believers are often discriminated against And he said the pandemic has highlighted the poor treatment of Christians There has been persecution since the church began years ago he said The Covid pandemic has made it even more stark Quite a lot of Christians are suffering not just because of their faith but they are also being discriminated against in terms of distribution of food in some of the developing world countries In parts of north India in Nepal or in parts of north Africa there are dominant religions who maybe see that their responsibility is to feed their own people look after their own people vaccinate their own people Christians are very much at the back of the queue and if there’s nothing left they don’t get The conference will run until Sunday August at Hamilton Road Presbyterian Church in Bangor Co Down Speakers will include Anglican Bishop Michael NazirAli below former Bishop of Raiwindi in Pakistan and Bishop of Rochester from until Mr Clarke said the bishop has firsthand knowledge of being a leader in a country where Christians are in the minority Coming from that area he has a very deep knowledge and understanding of the situation there for the Christian church he said But having moved to England and being Bishop of Rochester he has a much broader perspective than just Pakistan He has contacts with bishops in Africa and would have a bigger vision of the whole aspect of persecution This is maybe his third time here He’s a very good friend to the convention and is happy to come and speak Mr Clarke said laws allowing for religious freedom have been eroded in several countries particularly in India over the last to years Some regulations have been brought in which curtail basic rights he said The worry at the moment is that so many of those rights are being set aside or new laws are being brought in to override them That does cause real problems for Christians on the ground In things like education they find that they can be discriminated against Mr Clarke said staunch nationalism has been a driver of discrimination In India you’ve got the rise of the BJP party he said Its vision is India is for Hindus… You have others taking that sort of line In seeking to assert a national identity or ensure that an identity is preserved for future generations they look very critically at the role of other religious groups Even though they may have been in the country for hundreds of years they are seen as a threat to that national identity which they want to assert and so they would want to make sure that the laws and regulations protect the position of that national religion He added It isn’t just Christians Minority religions in these countries will be suffering the same thing Mr Clarke said the conference aimed to raise awareness of the plight of Christians under persecution It’s very difficult if you are a low caste Indian to do anything to influence the political system he said He added If you’re a very small sect and not a particularly powerful one within a country then your ability to influence situations not even at national level but at local level is very very limited That’s where the problems arise They persecuted Christians don’t have much political sway or political clout but if you’ve got people from outside the country lobbying governments on their behalf then that makes things a bit easier for them DUP MP Jim Shannon and Conservative MP Fiona Bruce will address the conference about the lobbying work they do for Christians and minority religious groups around the world Fiona Bruce is the prime minister’s special envoy for religious freedom in the world Mr Clarke said She gives Boris Johnson advice on different situations in different parts of the world where minority religions are under pressure Mr Shannon is a member of the joint Ecclesiastical Committee at Westminster Jim has been to Pakistan and has talked to Christian leaders in various countries so he has first hand experience of the situations that people are facing Mr Clarke said The conference is seeking to give them a voice particularly among the Christian community here Mr Clarke and his family have chosen to mark the anniversary of the convention with an intergenerational fitness challenge From January to August when the convention is held I said I would walk miles my daughter would run miles and my grandson Jed two would do lengths of his garden he said I’ve just passed by miles Jed is very close to his lengths and Joy is anticipating being finished by the end of the month It’s to raise money and also awareness Although the annual event will welcome people facetoface there will be restrictions on how many people can attend Hamilton Road Presbyterian Church has a capacity of up to but social distancing rules mean the convention can only accommodate around people this year Worshippers can take part in congregational singing but have to do so while wearing masks We normally don’t have any registration… In this case because of the restricted attendance figures we have to ask for prebooking Mr Clarke said We really want people to register so that we know how many people are coming When we hit the number registrations will close The conference will host Bible studies each weekday of the conference at Speaker Jonathan Lamb right ministeratlarge for Keswick Ministries has chosen to study the book of Habakkuk under the theme of Trusting God in turbulent times’ Mr Clarke said the lesserknown book has much to teach Christians in the time of Covid It’s a small book It’s in the middle of the Old Testament not very familiar to a lot of people but he Jonathan Lamb has chosen it to show that it’s relevant to today he said In situations where on the face of it things are falling apart they aren’t actually falling apart they are still under God’s control and certainly as Christians we should be taking heart from that Mr Clarke cautioned against suggestions that the pandemic is a form of God’s judgment or has any parallels with the Biblical plagues of Egypt There have been plagues throughout the world Black Death for example which don’t have any religious dimension to them he said You’ve got to be very careful in drawing parallels I think that one thing Christians would assert is for whatever reason this is happening this is happening under God’s control He added It would be a brave man or woman to say why it’s Covid been sent That would be putting yourself in the mind of God Mr Clarke said the pandemic has had a negative impact on some Christians but a positive one on others It’s very hard to generalise about the impact of Covid because I think the fact that people couldn’t meet has had an effect of distancing some people from their faith he said A regular pattern of meeting people each week was a way of strengthening their faith and their fellowship with other believers Even the last while it’s a very stilted form of meeting with distancing and gaps and masks That has had an impact on some people The other side of it is because it has been such a major thing and caused such major disruption it has caused some people to think a bit more deeply about things the reason for things and why they happen and who is in control of all of this For perhaps some people outside of the church it has caused them to ask questions which in a normal situation they wouldn’t have asked The Bangor Worldwide Missionary Convention will run from tomorrow until Sunday August n To register visit

more’ Archbishop Eamon Martin Catholic Primate WHEN I look back on what happened on this island in like many others in my community and tradition I do so with a deep sense of loss and also sadness Because for the past years partition has polarised people on this island It has institutionalised difference and it remains a symbol of cultural political and religious division between our communities I grew up in Derry just a few miles on the northern side of the border As a young boy I remember we often crossed the border to visit my granny and other relatives in Inishowen At first we did so through customs and then in later years through heavily fortified checkpoints It was as if my home city had been cut off in from its natural hinterland in beautiful Donegal That little boy has now grown up Today I reflect as a Church leader on the last years I have to face the difficult truth that perhaps we in the Churches could have done more to deepen our understanding of each other and to bring healing and peace to our divided and wounded communities Jesus grew up in the midst of political and cultural division and of deepseated historic difference But he taught his disciples to build bridges of love and forgiveness When he was asked Who is my neighbour he pointed to the Good Samaritan who crossed social and historic barriers to show love and mercy to the one who was on the other side’ That is why I stand here today as a disciple of Jesus with my brothers and sisters in faith hopeful and committed to doing what we can to build a better future for all a future in which mistrust and division can become things of the past Relationships must mature and strengthen across this island’ Dr David Bruce Presbyterian Moderator MY family came from the same part of the country as Eamon’s My father was born on a small county Derry farm years ago into a family with deep roots in Scottish Presbyterianism At various points in his life my father considered leaving Northern Ireland but despite the huge challenges of this century including the great depression of the the upheaval of the second world war and of course the Troubles he chose this as his home He chose to stay and worked to make it better I look back over these years with mixed feelings Northern Ireland is my home too and I love it But I lament the physical and emotional pain which has been caused over this last century to so many people by violence and the words which lead to violence Sadly such things remain and not only on this island In hope we long for a day when as the Apostle John describes it God will wipe every tear from our eyes and there will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain For now I grieve the times when fear has held us back from building relationships with those with whom we differ If we are to build a better future then we must recognise our own woundedness and our responsibility to care for the wounds of one another As we build that better future relationships of all sorts personal community religious and political must mature and strengthen across this island and between these islands As we meet as Church leaders I find myself around a table with others who have different national identities and political aspirations and yet with whom I share the same identity as a disciple of Jesus I find myself at home With my brothers and sisters I commit myself to building the mature strong relationships which we need as peace is built so that we become a community in which each can know they belong Young people want to build peace and care for this planet’ Dr Ivan Patterson President of the Irish Council of Churches I THINK we can sometimes underestimate the contribution of friendship to the work of building peace In a divided society simple moments of human connection and hospitality can have a profound impact Friendships with clergy from other churches has greatly enriched both my ministry and my personal life For me the starting point was interchurch youth work There I saw the value of setting an example through our friendship and collaboration for young people who were willing to take risks to build space in which they could listen respectfully to each other Today the religious landscape of this island has changed In an increasingly multicultural society Church and community are enriched by different cultures ethnicities and traditions We need to hear their voices too While it is important that we continue to show leadership to our young people by coming together as Church leaders we recognise that our failure even to talk well together about the ways in which the past continues to affect us all hampers them in addressing that unfinished work of peace so important for the future We have heard their voices clearly and powerfully today we need to learn from their example They are a generation who want to build peace a generation who respect and care for this planet in solidarity with the poorest and most vulnerable here and around the world As a disciple of Jesus with my brothers and sisters I commit myself to supporting that generation even where that means that we must sacrifice some things which were important in the past for the sake of those generations who are to come We obsessed about some things especially borders’ Archbishop John McDowell Church of Ireland Primate I WAS born in in working class east Belfast It was an immensely rich culture to grow up in So I have very warm memories of growing up and in a slightly more integrated housing estate than would be the case now My family would definitely have thought of themselves as unionist although my mother in particular also had a strong sense of Irish identity oddly enough centring round a Welsh Briton St Patrick However that integration I spoke about didn’t run very deep there was always a sense of them and us’ not far below the surface Friendship was plentiful Trust was in short supply Now as a Church leader I am sorry that as disciples of Jesus Christ we didn’t do more to become peacemakers or at least to speak peace into the situation Too often we allowed the attitudes around us to shape our faith rather than the other way round That’s certainly what I mean when I say we have too often been captive churches’ We obsessed about some things especially borders One way or another we’re obsessing about them again and being distracted from really thinking about what a good society would look like There are still far too many people who live with poverty of many kinds educational economic emotional Far from creating a society with a common purpose the pandemic and some recent political developments have exposed just how fractured a society we’ve become But I am hopeful Hopeful in a new generation who know that the big problems we’ve landed them with especially climate change and economic inequality can only be tackled together I think there are already signs that the next generation will see the things that we obsessed about as secondary and place their priorities elsewhere And as his disciples I think our role is to imitate Our Lord in acting justly loving mercy and walking humbly with our God Choose relationship and reconciliation’ Dr Sahr Yambasu Methodist President WE meet on the hill and in the Cathedral of St Patrick This is a place where the name of Christ and the values of love acceptance and embrace were preached the seeds of hope for enemies becoming friends were sown and reconciliation not just talked about but enacted Lest we forget before he became Patron Saint of Ireland Patrick was a slave here Here he suffered an intentional act of violence And here he was made to feel a little less human than those who enslaved him And yet it is to this place land and people he returned to spend the rest of his life enabling the Irish to find an alternative way of living in solidarity one with the other Patrick had every reason to hate the Irish and seek for vengeance But he didn’t Instead he forgave and was forgiven Consequently the history of this place could be summarised in one word Grace unmerited concern for the good of the other Embracing different others is not about promoting oneself It is about creating space for each other to flourish It is not about assimilating them into ourselves It is about recognising that there is something of us in the ones we embrace It is not about ignoring justice It is about creating space within ourselves for the perceived wrongdoer in hope of reconciliation That is what grace is it is choosing relationship over being right That is what Christianity is and should be about That is what Christian practice is

123,../data/sec_IRL/Irish News/Factiva-20230807-170,Ramping up reconciliation Wörter Dezember The Irish  IRISHN  c The Irish  Ltd All Rights reserved BACK in the summer of I was contacted by representatives of the Martin McGuinness Peace Foundation established to promote his contribution to peace and reconciliation nationally and internationally through a programme of education sport debate art and culture Sitting on the city’s walls adjacent to First Derry my heart started to race as I listened to a request from the Peace Foundation’s board of directors to hold a major reconciliation event in the church The next day a Sunday I met with a dozen elders after the service to inform them of this quite unpredicted request and to gauge reaction After a lengthy and at times difficult discussion a majority of the elders consented to grant use of the church to the Peace Foundation I recall being excited by the prospect of republicans and unionists meeting in the same sacred space No I wasn’t dreaming This was for real and almost too good to be true Aware however that such an event would not be everyone’s cup of tea I chose not to lose the run of myself Nonetheless I firmly believed an event in a church of all places would bear fruit Moreover it would signal that it was no longer business as usual This was an opportunity to press new buttons by doing something different Presbyterians and republicans gathering in a Protestant church was nothing short of miraculous One small step along the way to a shared future for all The unexpected arrival of the Covid pandemic delayed the event which finally took place at the end of October Unsurprisingly there were objections But the die had been cast and there was no turning back President Andrew Jackson once said Take time to deliberate but when the time for action arrives stop thinking and go in which is precisely what we did The audience on the night was nicely mixed People from both traditions were occupying pews in the church that reopened free of debt in thanks largely to Martin who succeeded in securing close to £ million to cover the cost of extensive refurbishment Conversations muffled by mandatory face coverings stopped suddenly as the strains of Danny Boy rang out around the church What a beginning Nothing could have been more appropriate to launch this totally unprecedented event An untravelled road was opening up before our eyes Perhaps the time had come to contemplate veering off the narrow ground that separates one tradition in Northern Ireland from the other and for us to move towards common ground where together we could muster the courage to be the change we desperately desire to see An innovative attempt at ramping up reconciliation was enriched by the attendance of college students More than anything Martin wanted the young growing up in cities towns and villages across the country to have a future different to his past Two students one from Foyle College in the Waterside and the other from St Cecilia’s College in Creggan stimulated the audience with their words as did Martin’s granddaughter with her singing Their intentional involvement at this bridgebuilding event served to illustrate the pivotal role history is giving to a rising generation who can help lead us toward a new age of togetherness One of Washington’s most influential figures Congressman Richard Neal was chosen by the Peace Foundation as keynote speaker Renowned for his ability to deliver the facts he captivated hearts and minds as he delivered albeit virtually a résumé of his friend Martin McGuinness who took an unparalleled path to peace and was a critical part of changing the course of history in Northern Ireland The former IRA commander who progressively transitioned to become peacemaker extraordinaire knew despite his readiness to reach out the hand of friendship there were many more hills to climb One of the last things he shared with me as we quietly chatted in the ICU ward at Altnagelvin hospital was David there is still more work to do Truer words have scarcely been spoken Bottom line we are now the ones who must reach higher and travel further accepting as Martin did there are people of goodwill who are Protestant unionist and loyalist just as there are people of goodwill who are Catholic nationalist and republican While one swallow will never make a summer that is no reason for letting the grass grow under our feet Courageous initiatives that bring different creeds and cultures to meet and mix laugh and learn such as the Derry Meeting House model must become top priority across the country James Conant the first US ambassador to West Germany famously said Behold the turtle makes progress only when he sticks out his neck Sometimes it takes a big step such as the one taken recently by Presbyterians and republicans in DerryLondonderry to show us that a new life and a new mould can be shaped An enduring message emerging from this bespoke evening of reconciliation is Humanity has done hard things before we can do hard things now The time is therefore ripe to start thinking not just of ourselves but of generations yet unborn and to gird ourselves for the marathon that will be needed to make this place the best place on earth to live in n Rev David Latimer is the retired minister of First Derry Presbyterian Church

138,../data/sec_IRL/Irish News/Factiva-20230807-1701(1,First to resign from papacy in years Wörter Januar The Irish  IRISHN  c The Irish  Ltd All Rights reserved POPE Emeritus Benedict XVI was the first pontiff in years to resign from the job The shy German theologian who tried to reawaken Christianity in a secularised Europe stunned the world on February when he announced that he no longer had the strength to run the billionstrong Catholic Church that he had steered for eight years His dramatic decision paved the way for the conclave that elected Pope Francis as his successor The two popes then lived sidebyside in the Vatican gardens an unprecedented arrangement that set the stage for future popes emeritus to do the same The former Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger never wanted to be pope and had planned at the age of to spend his final years writing in the peace and quiet of his native Bavaria However he inherited the seemingly impossible task of following in the footsteps of John Paul II when he was elected on April Benedict became the oldest pope in years and the first German in nearly years He was forced to follow the footsteps of the beloved St John Paul II and run the church during the fallout from the clerical sex abuse scandal A second scandal erupted when his own butler stole his personal papers and gave them to a journalist Being elected pope Benedict once said felt like a guillotine had come down on him Nevertheless he set about the job with a singleminded vision to rekindle the faith in a world that he frequently lamented seemed to think it could do without God Benedict relaxed restrictions on celebrating the old Latin Mass and launched a crackdown on American nuns insisting that the church should stay true to its doctrine and traditions in the face of a changing world It was a path that in many ways was reversed by his successor Francis whose mercyovermorals priorities alienated the traditionalists who had been so indulged by Benedict Benedict’s style could not have been more different from that of John Paul or Francis Once nicknamed God’s Rottweiler by the media he was no globetrotting media darling or populist But the widelymisunderstood Benedict was a teacher theologian and academic to the core quiet and pensive but with a fierce mind He spoke in paragraphs not soundbites It was Benedict’s devotion to history and tradition that endeared him to members of the traditionalist wing of the Catholic Church For them Benedict remained even in retirement a beacon of nostalgia for the orthodoxy and Latin Mass of their youth and the pope they much preferred over Francis Like his predecessor Benedict made reaching out to Jews a hallmark of his papacy His first official act as pope was a letter to Rome’s Jewish community and he became the second pope in history after John Paul to enter a synagogue In his book Jesus Of Nazareth Benedict made a sweeping exoneration of the Jewish people for the death of Christ explaining biblically and theologically why there was no basis in Scripture for the argument that the Jewish people as a whole were responsible for Jesus’s death Yet Benedict also offended some Jews who were incensed at his constant defence of and promotion toward sainthood of Pope Pius XII the Second World Warera pope accused by some of having failed to sufficiently denounce the Holocaust They also harshly criticised Benedict when he removed the excommunication of a traditionalist British bishop who had denied the Holocaust Benedict riled Muslims with a speech in September five years after the September attacks in the US in which he quoted a Byzantine emperor who characterised some of the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad as evil and inhuman particularly his command to spread the faith by the sword A subsequent comment after the massacre of Christians in Egypt led the Al Azhar center in Cairo the seat of Sunni Muslim learning to suspend ties with the Vatican that were only restored under Francis The Vatican under Benedict suffered some notorious PR gaffes with the pope himself being to blame on occasion He enraged the United Nations and several European governments in when en route to Africa he told reporters that the Aids problem could not be resolved by distributing condoms On the contrary it increases the problem Benedict said A year later he issued a revision saying that if a male prostitute were to use a condom to avoid passing HIV to his partner he might be taking a first step towards a more responsible sexuality But Benedict’s legacy was irreversibly coloured by the global eruption in of the sex abuse scandal even though as a cardinal he was responsible for turning the Vatican around on the issue Documents revealed that the Vatican knew about the problem and yet turned a blind eye for decades at times rebuffing bishops who tried to do the right thing Benedict had firsthand knowledge of the scope of the problem since his old office the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith which he had headed since was responsible for dealing with abuse cases In fact it was he who before becoming pope took the thenrevolutionary decision in to assume responsibility for processing those cases after he realised bishops around the world were not punishing abusers but were just moving them from parish to parish leaving them free to carry out more attacks And once he became pope Benedict essentially reversed his beloved predecessor John Paul by taking action against the century’s most notorious paedophile priest the Rev Marcial Maciel Benedict took over Maciel’s Legionaries of Christ a conservative religious order held up as a model of orthodoxy by John Paul after it was revealed that Maciel sexually abused seminarians and fathered at least three children In retirement Benedict was faulted by an independent report for his handling of four priests while he was bishop of Munich He denied any personal wrongdoing but apologised for any grievous faults As soon as the abuse scandal calmed down for Benedict another one erupted He made his last public appearances in February and then boarded a helicopter to the papal summer retreat at Castel Gandolfo to sit out the conclave in private Benedict then largely kept to his word that he would live a life of prayer in retirement emerging only occasionally from his converted monastery for

INSTANT CONNECTION ON FIRST DATE Fermanagh mumoftwo who survived car blaze on work faith and life with hubby Ray By Ivan Little MIRACLE mum Melanie Grimsley who survived a horrific car fire which claimed the life of her older sister years ago has opened her heart about finding love a second time around after the breakup of her first marriage to her teenage sweetheart Thirtyfouryearold Melanie from Kesh in Co Fermanagh says she couldnt be happier after tying the knot with health service professional Ray Maxwell who she met on a Christian dating site three years ago Melanie and her first husband Brian Higgins who have two sons together were divorced in five years after they were married in Enniskillen But the motheroftwo said she and Brian whos also from Fermanagh simply grew apart We were very young at the time of the wedding But theres no bad blood we all get on well now and Brian sees the boys regularly said Melanie who had been left with horrendous burns after the unexplained fire which swept through her mothers car in April when she popped into a shop in Enniskillen to buy milk Passerby Oliver Quinn bravely pulled Melanie from the inferno but he couldnt save her sister Amanda who was almost three Oliver was guest of honour at Melanies wedding which was the subject of a UTV documentary and she later wrote a book Beauty for Ashes about her long and painful road to recovery Melanie who had to endure cruel catcalling and stares because of her injuries later gained a first class honours degree in law after studying for three years at the Ulster Universitys Magee campus She was among the top students in her year and dedicated her dissertation to her late sister Amanda Melanie then embarked on an apprenticeship with Murnaghan Fee solicitors in Enniskillen who dealt with her compensation case after the fire But her dream of becoming a fullyfledged lawyer fell apart after the second part of her legal practices qualification course that she was expecting to attend in Derry was dropped by university officials and she said she got little notice that she would have to study instead in Belfast which is twice the distance from Kesh as Derry But with two sons to look after Melanie said she was heartbroken when her argument that she couldnt be expected to travel for over five hours every day was ignored and she was told that she couldnt work from home even for one or two days a week Ive always really dedicated myself to my studies and I could have succeeded with homeworking just as people are doing now because of the pandemic said Melanie who added that she felt she had no choice but to give up on her legal dreams However Melanie decided to move with her sons Leo and Will to Holywood Co Down in a bid to broaden the job opportunities open to her I also wanted a new chapter for me and the boys said Melanie I had lived my whole life in Kesh and I thought it would be good to spread my wings It was a big departure for me I didnt know anyone in Holywood and didnt even really know the town but because I am from Fermanagh I couldnt have lived somewhere that was landlocked I had to see water And I really love it here though I do miss Fermanagh In Melanie met Ray whos on a Christian dating website and after chatting to each other online and seeing their photographs and profiles the couple met up for a coffee in Belfast We talked for ages and there was just a connection between us said Melanie who added that Ray is a senior rehab worker for people with sensory disabilities and was based in Portadown Ray who also has two children from a previous marriage and Melanie tied the knot in June last year and live together in Holywood It was great that we had got to know each other for who we were not who we might have been before said Melanie Ray and I took things slowly at first for our childrens sake but hes a lot of fun and the boys enjoyed their time with him as well as loving the time with their dad at weekends Ray and I are very different in many ways but we are really compatible as well I think we knew we had clicked fairly quickly and we both realised there could be something longer term in our relationship Life comes in chapters And I think Ray and I met at the right time The couple were married in June last year in Lowe Memorial Presbyterian church at Finaghy in Belfast where a very special guest said a prayer for them That man was Roy Miller the plastic surgeon who literally reshaped Melanies young life rebuilding her face and hands Mr Miller who had also helped victims of the IRAs La Mon bombing in carried out countless procedures on Melanie when she was growing up But they met by chance again in Holywood after Melanie moved there and joined a church where Mr Miller and his wife Rosemary worshipped A close friendship developed and even though Melanie moved to another church in Belfast the relationship with the Millers has endured Melanie is now an administrator of the church where she and Ray wed Her son Will walked her up the aisle along with her father William as her other son Leo sang The Star of the County Down On lockdown Melanie has been working from home and schooling her sons She said Its nice to have had more time with the boys but it was frustrating for weeks that we couldnt get down to Fermanagh to see our family there Melanie has also been helping to stream church services as well as organising zoom gatherings and prayer meetings But are any christenings likely in the future for Melanie and Ray No she replied People are always asking me that But we have four children between us we are perfectly happy And something else that has also enhanced Melanies life is her hair She lost most of it in the fire and has relied on wearing wigs but now a foundation set up by TV presenter and model Katie Piper who was the victim of an acid attack is helping Melanie who said They were able to source and fund a hair replacement system which is more like a semipermanent solution It is attached in a different way so that you dont have to take it on and off all the time Its been lifechanging for me As for the future Melanie hasnt ruled out furthering her studies She said It was so frustrating that they came to a halt because I was doing so well and enjoying the studying so much Theres now a possibility of me working towards a masters degree in human rights I havent fallen out of love with the law

dancing is allowed again but I am happy to keep dancing at home if I never get to dance in public again I would be happy enough Sharons passion for the culture has seeped into every room in her neat

funds for hospice that cared for siblingsmum One woman bought our biscuitsbut they looked so real her partner tried to eat them Each knit can take hours but its time well spent say sisters KNITTED cakes and biscuits that look good enough to eat are making their way into the kitchens of little and big kids thanks to the creativity of two Belfast sisters Retired school teachers Lynda Wallace and Suzanne Kelly are selling their beautifully crafted fancies through a new charity they have set up in aid of Marie Curie called Knitted Food Inc Every penny from the sale of their fruitladen pavlova slices pretty pink doughnuts and many other sweet treats goes to the charity as a thank you from the women for the care and support given to their late mum Elizabeth Kelly during her final days Lifelong knitter Lynda is the creative force behind the artistic venture while sister Suzanne takes care of the promotion orders and deliveries With the charity only having been launched in November the sisters are delighted that some of their first customers are coming back for seconds after friends and family marvelled at how realistic Lyndas creations were While the knits were initially aimed at children adults have bought them as display items for kitchens The sisters were devastated when their mum Elizabeth was diagnosed with terminal breast cancer just before the start of the pandemic in early She spent her final two weeks being cared for in Belfasts Marie Curie Hospice where she passed away in July Now as the charity prepares to launch its annual Daffodil Appeal the girls are hoping their creations will boost its coffers Suzanne said We set up the business to support Marie Curie and in memory of mum Mum was cared for in the charitys east Belfast hospice and we feel indebted to the staff for the care and dignity they gave not just to mum but to us too It was especially difficult because of Covid and lockdown restrictions but they really did make the pain of losing her as easy as it could be Suzanne who lives in Holywood taught at the Belfast School of Music before she retired She plays the piano and the organ and is the musical director of the Regent Street Presbyterian Church in Newtownards Lynda who lives in Dundonald taught sciences at Antrim Grammar School before her retirement She is married to Norman a retired aircraft inspector and they have two daughters Julie and Lisa and one grandson Thomas who is five It was Thomas who inspired Lynda a lifelong knitter to start creating food items as toys She explained My grandson loved playing with the kitchen at playgroup so we bought him one of his own in I knitted him a lemon meringue pie It didnt look right but he was happy with it so I knitted him some biscuits I then Googled food knits and did a few other things Thomas played with them rather than the plastic food so I knitted cakes with layers as it made them more solid and easier to wash In after mum passed away I said to Suzanne If I knit will you sell to raise money for Marie Curie It went from there Lynda spent the guts of the next two years knitting to build up stock before Suzanne launched the charity on Facebook in November of last year She now has items perfected through trial and error Her range includes realistic pavlova slices cheesecake Victoria sponge and other favourites such as Jammie Dodgers and custard creams Suzanne took her first batch to a Christup mas fair in her local church where the knits were snapped up She said business had boomed ever since adding I sold quite a lot at the Christmas fair and then had people coming back and saying they were great and asking for more Lynda is a bit of a perfectionist so the detail on them is incredible People have commented they cant believe how realistic they are We thought they would be bought solely as toys for children to play with but we have so many adults who bought them too One woman put some biscuits she bought on a plate for display in her kitchen She told us her husband came in and lifted one to eat thinking it was the real thing She came back and ordered more for her friends The sisters cover the cost of the wool and dont charge for the many hours it takes Lynda to make each knit A single slice of cake can take to nine hours to perfect but sells for just £ with biscuits £ each or five for £ So far they have raised around £ for the charity through sales It is a positive response to a shattering loss for the sisters who were both very close to their mum BUSY Suzanne said I never faced grief like it before I feel as if a part of me died with my mum and Lynda has been very affected too Mum was so full of life She was going on She loved her clothes and was so busy you had to make an appointment to see her She played bridge all her life Her diagnosis came out of the blue To lose her just seven months later was such a shock We set up the charity in her memory and as long as Lynda is happy to keep knitting I am happy to keep selling We will keep going and hopefully it will help the wonderful work of Marie Curie Lynda has created knitting patterns for all the items in the range and is hoping to add more She said I have loads of ideas in my head I realised that everything I have knitted so far wouldnt be the healthiest of foods so I hope to add some fruit and vegetables to the range Ive seen a knitted breakfast online which I think would be fun too It was a shock to lose mum and it was very hard because of lockdown too Anything we can do to help Marie Curie we will do because they have been so good Suzanne and Lynda will be marking the loss of their mother on March Marie Curies National Day of Reflection The occasion provides an opportunity to remember loved ones who have died while

disappointing week for anyone counting on blizzard conditions for distraction and amusement not to mention nostalgia for those innocent times during the Beast from the East when being stuck at home for four days seemed like an eternity But if the snow doesnt materialise in full winterwonderland quantities until later in the week anyway the precipitation anticipation teaches us something courtesy of Morning Ireland RTÉ Radio weekdays On Tuesday presenter Rachael English tackles the question thats gripped the nation since oh Sunday what do you call that stuff thats not quite snow not quite hail The answer according to meteorologist Alan OReilly is graupel OReilly explains the science behind these frozen snowflakes insert joke about chilly millennials here while voicing mild surprise that its a new word to many A lot of people didnt seem to know Ive been saying it for years but I was maybe out on my own with that one Well youre finally in vogue now replies English sounding inadvertently dismissive In fact as the day progresses the graupel trend does indeed er snowball Ray DArcy often seems slightly behind the curve on zeitgeisty matters on his afternoon show RTÉ Radio weekdays if only because Ryan Tubridy has usually beaten him to the juicy topics But with Tubridy somehow having missed the memo on this occasion he talks vaguely about that little nonsnow thing like a flurry DArcy seizes his moment Word of the day he declares triumphantly The presenter replays OReillys interview with English feigning sounds of interest throughout He was a trailblazer when it comes to graupel DArcy concludes sounding properly dismissive I can tell you here and now its not going to take off were not going to use it Sure enough the erstwhile mot du jour already seems passé by the time English introduces the weather forecast on the following days Morning Ireland Any chance of a bit of graupel today she asks knowingly practically putting ironic air quotes around the word DArcy is right it seems graupels moment in the sun lasts about as long as well a snowflake in the sun Fashion is so fickle As OReilly says during his interview Nothing is like the weather in terms of uncertainty Escape from numbing drudgery With everything thats happening conversations on such ephemera may seem wilfully trivial But they provide escapism from the numbing drudgery of interviews analysis and speculation on the pandemic And not just for listeners On Tuesday Drivetime RTÉ Radio weekdays Sarah McInerney and Cormac Ó hEadhra are positively giddy as they discuss emotional spending a once niche phenomenon now more relevant amidst lockdowndriven online retail sprees Financial advisor Eoin McGee sees shopping on the internet as a muchneeded liftmeup which can nonetheless result in excessive spending What youre describing sounds eerily familiar says McInerney who describes the collective gasp in her home whenever the postman arrives with parcels Is there anything really wrong with it she asks slightly plaintively McGee explains that without normal barriers its too easy to splash cash on a whim In particular he points to the perils of tipsy shopping aka hic and click as practised by some online consumers typically women This assertion prompts splutters of mock outrage from Ó hEadhra I would like to apologise on behalf of all men But the outspoken presenter also admires McGees honesty You know what I like about you Eoin youre not trying to make friends youre telling the unvarnished truth says a chuckling Ó hEadhra possibly projecting his own outspoken persona onto his guest In truth its a bit of light relief rather than anything more serious particularly as the discussion trades in anecdotal evidence rather than hard data But its also the liveliest item on the show suggesting that the two presenters welcome the diversion Not that theyre slacking in other departments On Wednesday Ó hEadhra has an illuminating encounter with Fianna Fáil TD Willie ODea The Limerick deputy cheerily admits to using colourfully insulting terms about Minister for Transport and coalition partner Eamon Ryan over the latters now withdrawn opposition to a local road project the Greens grand vision hasnt a chance against parishpump priorities Meanwhile McInerney interviews Tánaiste Leo Varadkar with characteristic rigour What will be different in the new Living with Covid plan that isnt in the old plan she asks I cant tell you yet because its still in development Varadkar replies with discouraging honesty When the Tánaiste outlines the obstacles that precluded the government introducing mandatory quarantine until now the hosts merciless assessment resonates So just leave it because its too difficult Discussions such as this underline why Drivetime currently has the zippiest news coverage on Irish radio And while the presenters enjoy the odd slice of flippancy it doesnt always work An item with TD Mick Barry and tailor Louis Copeland on whether wearing ties should be obligatory in politics seems promising but ends up sounding staged and flat You can never tell with fashion items The reigning monarch When it comes to turning offbeat material into absorbing radio Sean Moncrieff talk weekdays is the reigning monarch no mean feat considering hes been helming his show since True he also deals with more substantive issues comfortable whether discussing the efficacy and ethics of puberty blocking medication or hearing about homelessness outreach by the Muslim Sisters of Eire But he still sounds happiest when dealing with quirkier subjects Mondays regular stuff that changed the world slot with Simon Tierney deals with the hearse but despite the vehicles serious purpose the segment is unexpectedly entertaining Egged on by the host Tierney recounts fascinating nuggets about hearses such as the increased efficiency they brought to the funeral business Its a satisfyingly informative item displaying Moncrieffs grasp of a good subject no matter how morbid with weather and pandemics so unpredictable best to stick with the one certainty in life Moment of the Week Pandemic party pooper Mondays edition of Today with Claire Byrne RTÉ Radio carries a vivid item from reporter Brian OConnell who joins gardaí on Covid patrol in Cork City on a weekend night Theres much moving on of outdoor revelries as well as dutiful Garda quotes We dont make the law we enforce the law But the most startling moment comes when the guards respond to a call complaining about a house party made by one of the occupants The man explains that

160,../data/sec_IRL/Irish Times/Factiva-20230807-165,Opinion Religion for religion’s sake is gone in pandemic Leadership has not come and will not come from a moribund clerical caste Maria Jansson Wörter März      On March we closed the doors of the cathedral here in Waterford asked that the Friends of the Cathedral stay at home cancelled choir practice and a planned youth group weekend away little knowing what lay ahead On March we broadcast our first Sunday service from the cathedral and have done so since The first lockdown was horrendous as muchloved parishioners died in quick succession firstly with present at their funerals then at the funeral of a young mother of four Ireland does death well and the gathering of the community is a hugely important element in the grieving process However not only are the bereft denied the community recognition due to their loved one the community has no means of grieving its cherished members And yet we have all now adapted to online funerals on ripie Usually Baptisms happened during the Sunday service but now they occur privately Confirmations have been cancelled because preparation would not be safe or feasible as this is done at parish not school level There have been three weddings The first tragically in Waterford University Hospital when a terminally ill man married his partner of many years just days before his death The second had present and the third was during this latest lockdown allowing only six people to be present A real casualty of the pandemic has been communal life simply meeting each other in church bellringing in Sunday school in choir on vestry at parish events dropping in on each other the list goes on In future older parishioners will be wary of coming back to church Given that you can now turn off the preacher if heshe is waffling online and church hop on the internet from bed the habit of faith community may have been broken for good not just for the occasionals but also the regulars Over the year connections with the diocese and larger church have been contrived and artificial having the usual synods and meetings by Zoom the superstructure of bishops and administration at best distant in most parishioners lives is now utterly redundant Clergy must be local visible in contact and engaged or become irrelevant To date thankfully parishioners donations in the Waterford parishes have held up but the income we make in the cathedral from the shop and concerts has simply ended and this pays the huge costs of running insuring staffing heating and maintaining a cathedral Luckily we went into the pandemic debt free with the belfry and roof renovated but there are huge financial challenges ahead Despite all this there have been some really important changes for the good Even though telephone calls are not an ideal means of communication they have enabled real conversations with many who otherwise would have been at work or too busy I have got to know some members of the community better because of lockdowns Reticent People were rather reticent about talking about their faith but I have been blown away with their engagement in a venture that started on October last Prayer at Breakfast which lasts six to eight minutes each day Now we have just passed the day of this and between tune in daily If I went to the cathedral and did morning prayer there every day I would be lucky to have three people with me For some smaller funerals have been strange but more intimate The tremendous crowds of the past offered valued respect for the dead and the bereft but were equally challenging for the grieving when at their most vulnerable If the pandemic changes the way we do weddings that will be a good thing People know they do not have to remortgage their lives now to wed things have become simpler and more genuine Religion has big challenges ahead over and above financial ones There are parishes where the bond between priest and people has deepened over the last year and others where it has vaporised Relying on the ways things were done in the past will not be adequate People have recovered their faith and need for God and if that is not the foundation of what we do going forward then forget it Religion for religions sake is gone and that is not a bad thing We will have to meet as people of faith with a renewed authenticity and open a real conversation about rebuilding church In the past nontalk prevailed women and minorities sat and listened children and young people were irrelevant finance and church fabric took precedence over energising community and faith The challenge and the opportunity will be in developing authentic Christian community again Leadership has not come and will not come from a moribund clerical caste it will come from the people who want community who reclaim their voice who know the connection between faith and real life who have found the spiritual strength in the pandemic to prevail and who now must step up to the bar and start rebuilding Exciting times ahead Rev Maria Jansson is Church of Ireland Dean of Waterford

Christianity Judaism and Islam Naomi O’Leary Wörter März      This Sunday Pope Francis will walk through the ruins of old Mosul in northern Iraq to pray in the remains of a cluster of ancient churches used as a headquarters by Islamic State and left in rubble by the war The message will be life is stronger than death said Fr Olivier Poquillon a Dominican friar who is overseeing the Unesco reconstruction of local landmark churches Al Saa and AlTahera which still stands roofless It will not be a speech it will be a prayer for all suffering caused by human violence The visit to Mosul an ancient crossroads of cultures captured by the militant group in its genocidal campaign to create a puritan state it vowed would reach Rome is one deeply symbolic stop in a trip that is rich with significance Francis will hold an interreligious service at a city considered the birthplace of Abraham father figure in the three religions of Christianity Judaism and Islam to emphasise the common roots and brotherhood of the faiths The trip includes an unprecedented meeting with preeminent Shia leader Grand Ayatollah Ali alSistani who is said to rarely agree to visits The message of peaceful coexistence is an essential one for the future of local Christian communities who have deep historical roots in the region Masses on the trip will be partly held in Chaldean a local language descended from Aramaic the mother tongue of Jesus The biblical resonances are also profound Mosul stands on the banks of the river Tigris across from the remnants of the biblical city of Nineveh home to Jonas another prophet common to the faiths Fr Poquillon considers the trip to a region associated with Genesis and the Garden of Eden as bringing together Franciss appeal against wars and for common responsibility to care for creation expressed in his encyclicals Fratelli Tutti and Laudato si Visit of succour The decision to take the trip with the pandemic still raging and amid ongoing instability has raised eyebrows The Vaticans health service organised for the entire papal entourage including the accompanying journalists to be vaccinated with Pfizer jabs ahead of the journey The Vatican first planned an Iraq trip two decades ago and feels it cannot further delay what is now a visit of succour to the local Christian communities whose numbers have been severely depleted by persecution and conflict unleashed by the invasion of Iraq in After touching down in Baghdad today Pope Francis will visit the Syriac Catholic Church Our Lady of Salvation the site of a massacre by alQaedalinked militants who burst into Sunday Mass and killed worshippers including two priests The Christian community of Qaraqosh in northern Iraq who Francis will meet this Sunday are people who fled for their lives on August when Islamic State also known as Isis swept the Nineveh plains and seized their city The Chaldean Catholic Archbishop of Mosul Najeeb Michaeel recounted the flight in a recent interview with author Hadani Ditmars in which he recalled fleeing within sight of pickup trucks of Isis militants armed with Kalashnikovs As chief archivist at Al Saa church in Mosul the archbishop had been leading a digitalisation effort to preserve the trove of rare ancient Muslim Christian and Yezidi manuscripts held in the Dominican priory He rescued this ancient written heritage by bundling the manuscripts into his car and when he was forced to abandon the vehicle fellow fleeing people helped to carry the and manuscripts by hand to the safety of Erbil We preserved this collection of manuscripts photographs and archives archbishop Michaeel said in the interview This history of Mesopotamia and all its religious minorities Daesh Isis tried to destroy our heritage as well as our people We tried to save both Christian population drop The Christian population of Mosul has dropped from tens of thousands to or families according to Fr Poquillon who described hopes among the mixed Muslim and Christian restoration workers that rebuilding the devastated area would encourage minorities to return Mosul is like a mosaic Fr Poquillon said Our aim is to restore this sense of living together In line with this spirit the restoration of the churches was funded by the majorityMuslim United Arab Emirates in a decision inspired by the signing of a joint declaration of human fraternity by Pope Francis and leading Sunni authority the Grand Imam of Egypts AlAzhar Ahmed elTayeb For Francis theres a sense of coming full circle His first visit as pope in was to Lampedusa the Italian island that was an arrival point for the mass migration of people across the Mediterranean driven by conflict in the Middle East He cast a wreath into the sea in memory of the many who drowned The Iraq visit will culminate with a Mass held in an openair stadium in the Kurdish city of Erbil A prayer will be spoken in Arabic for the Christians of the Middle East in Kurdish for our

them to steal a march on political rivals Details of major capital investments are supposed to remain secret until the big announcement but Ministers regularly pass on information to party members in advance so they can break the good news ahead of the competition Minister for the Environment Darragh OBrien was due in his Fingal constituency at yesterday to announce funding for eight urban regeneration projects in Dublin city and county With € million to spend in the second round of disbursements under the scheme some of the Ministers colleagues were keen to get the word out quickly to impress voters They included Senators Catherine Ardagh and Mary Fitzpatrick right who both just missed out on Dáil seats in the last election The two Fianna Fáil politicians were so eager to spread the good news that they took to social media first thing yesterday morning before the Minister was due to speak Fantastic news € for Dublin City Projects trumpeted Mary Delighted to see such huge investment announced for the South West Inner City gushed Catherine with € writ large above her head But their joy unfortunately remained confined when they were told by headquarters they had jumped the gun The posts were quickly taken down But they were up again as soon as Darragh opened his mouth in Balbriggan Meanwhile Westmeathbased Senator Aidan Davitt has also been the bearer of glad tidings this week emailing county councillors all over the country with an update on the proposed pay increase for local authority members In his message headed Commitment from Minister McGrath on the Moorhead Report Davitt Working with Councillors for Councillors said a motion due for discussion at this weeks Fianna Fáil parliamentary party meeting had been deferred I understand from my colleague Senator Diarmuid Wilson that he spoke with Minister Michael McGrath last evening and that the Minister indicated it was his intention that this matter will be brought to Government in the coming weeks with a view to it being implemented by June as promised in the programme for government The Cabinet agreed as much last month I sincerely hope that this matter will now come to a satisfactory conclusion wrote Davitt who should be well got with the Minister as he was Fianna Fáil Seanad spokesperson on Public Expenditure and Reform until he lost the whip following his attendance at last years Golfgate dinner Happily it was restored in January after five months in the wilderness Step change It is generally agreed that the Labour Party has upped its game in recent months Leader Alan Kelly while still a martyr to the amateur dramatics has eased up noticeably on the histrionics and adopted a more considered and conciliatory approach during his Dáil outings Despite its reduced circumstances just six TDs and five Senators the party is performing well on the big issues The quality of Dáil contributions during major debates has attracted favourable media attention and generated welcome publicity Speeches combining criticism of the Government with constructive suggestions show a welcome willingness not to sacrifice substance for soundbite But that new energy and engagement is not translating into an increase in support The party remains deep in the opinion poll doldrums What to do There are whispers around Leinster House that Labour is planning a big relaunch in autumn However a spokesperson brushed aside the suggestion saying they were concentrating on recruiting new members and reorganising around the country This weekend sees the launch of a month long Sign Up A Sister campaign where existing members are asked to encourage women to get more involved in politics and sign up to Labour for free On Monday the Senators are launching a womens manifesto for International Womens Day And while headquarters is saying there are no plans for a relaunch in autumn one senior Labour source tells us it is definitely on the cards Youd be right about that I dont know what exactly is envisaged but it is one of a number of things we are doing such as rebuilding around the country and improving our social media output The party has been getting great coverage but its not showing in the polls Everyone knows the party needs a refresh It has gone staid and stale and we need to regroup and keep pushing through New political director Cónán Ó Broin and recently appointed general secretary Billie Sparks are driving the push forward Labour could not go ahead with its annual conference this month and is hoping to hold it in the autumn It will be Alan Kellys first conference as leader and the ideal time to unveil the new look Will it be a full rebranding Will the red rose emblem go More of a refresh We wont be losing the rose Were doing stuff now that resonates with a lot of people and theres a great esprit de corps among the TDs and the Senators especially the new Senators We all know that we have to keep that spirit going and push well beyond the six seats in the next election or else well be gone Theres no point on going off on agendas that people dont get at all Were not doing virtue signalling like our cousins in the Soc Dems Former senator Kevin Humphreys who is the new national organiser says Labour is working hard on the ground We are back up and running in places gone from us since Membership figures are well up They will be keeping a close eye on developments across the water where details emerged this week of a review commissioned by UK Labour which recommended radical rebranding of the party to win back former voters Leader Sir Keir Starmer while regarded by focus groups as a positive asset was also seen as a leader who likes sitting on the fence The strategy which Starmer has not endorsed suggests Labour should appear more patriotic making more use of the flag veterans and dressing smartly in a effort to distance the party from its disastrous performance under Jeremy Corbyns leadership Tribute For all of you who have just returned from a trip to Mars and dont know the news its International Womens Day on Monday Needless to say the politicians have gone mad marking the occasion with online events to beat the band speeches in the Dáil and Seanad and all sorts of socially distant announcements on the plinth And where would Mná na hÉireann be without virtual roundtables International Womens Day goes on for well over a week The Minister for Justice kicked off a plethora of engagements yesterday morning with a video address to the Polish embassys International Womens Day event The speech by Helen

Polish colleagues working in a variety of areas including in frontline jobs in An Garda Síochána the Border Management Unit and the Irish Prison Service I would like to personally thank them for their dedication and commitment especially during the past year when our frontline services have faced immense challenges On Monday Poland figures again when members of the Oireachtas AllParty Group on

negatively stereotyped writes Sorcha Pollak Sorcha Pollak Wörter März      Its on a Friday in February and Met Éireann has issued a snow and ice warning for most of the country urging people to stay inside as temperatures plummet nationwide Flecks of snow blow across OConnell street as a biting cold wind roars under the arches of the GPO Around the corner on Princes Street North Lorraine OConnor is coordinating the transfer of boxes and bags of food from a couple of parked cars to a group of women setting up tables outside the post offices front entrance After seven years of organising the Muslim Sisters of Éires MSOE Friday soup kitchen OConnor runs the evening like clockwork This week they have hot dishes ready to hand out along with fruit cheese biscuits bread fizzy drinks and doughnuts Outside the GPO a crowd of about people has already gathered waiting patiently to collect their dinner packages They include single men young couples families with five six sometimes seven children Dublin accents mix with languages from across the globe as the diverse group stamp their feet to keep warm Shortly after the women lined up behind the tables start handing out food and the queue begins to move forward OConnor hovers nearby staying away from the crowd because of an underlying health issue but keeping a sharp eye on every single movement Im kind of like the mother hen watching she tells me Marcin Paskowski is near the top of queue An electrician by trade he lives in a nearby apartment but rarely can afford food after paying all his bills he says I try not to abuse the system so dont come here too often But I havent eaten anything for hours when Im starving I come A couple of metres behind Leonard is hugging his girlfriend Elizabetha to stay warm Were homeless so we come here every night to get fed she says We used to sleep on the streets but now weve got a hostel Hopefully soon well find a gaff John Hennessy stands at the tables distributing hand sanitiser and handing out masks to the growing line of people which now snakes around the corner onto Jervis Street He volunteers with soup runs around the capital six nights of the week and started doing security and general crowd control for MSOE a few years ago No matter where you go in Dublin youll find someone in a tent someone wrapped in a sleeping bag he says But the one thing they wont do is starve Theres someone doing a soup run every night of the week at least The Muslim sisters first started outreach meals nine years ago at the Merchants House Quay homeless charity OConnor recalls the shock on peoples faces when women in headscarves emerged from the kitchen with trays of food They thought we were nuns and asked what order we came from They were surprised but they just wanted to know who we were There was no hostility After a few years of distributing food around the city centre OConnor decided in to set up a Friday night stand on OConnell Street The first evening was very hostile admits OConnor In the beginning there were lots of people who were not sure about women in hijabs But when I told them I was Lorraine from Coolock Im a northside girl it opened a dialogue It gained trust and understanding This didnt happen overnight but the trust there is now amazing Homeless people are stereotyped so are Muslim women Theyre stereotyped because they have addictions because they dont have a home They are the forgotten people in our own society When the pandemic hit last year the group put the weekly Friday runs temporarily on hold Everybody was terrified at that stage but then I got the call from Tesco saying they still had food for us If I said no all that food would get binned We put a call out on our Facebook and ended up sending hampers a week out my front door most went to nonMuslim families The charity group also continued distributing bags of food and hot tea to people living in tents along the Grand Canal along with gift deliveries to children in direct provision throughout the pandemic OConnor converted to Islam and started wearing a hijab in nearly years after she married her Muslim husband The first few years of wearing the head scarf were not easy she says I became Muslim for myself not for any man But I also became an immigrant within my own country I started having racial abuse people around me accused me of forgetting where I came from I was surprised by the hostile mindset people had towards Muslim women I wondered should I strip off this hijab go back to being Catholic Or should I move forward with the faith I firmly believed in She chose the latter option and went back to college to study for a masters in womens studies The goal of MSOE which OConnor set up years ago is not only to support some of societys most vulnerable people but to dispel preconceived notions about Muslim women she says The whole point of Muslim Sisters of Éire was to break that stereotype and show people Muslim women are not oppressed theyre very much a part of Irish society Attitudes towards difference in Irish society have changed drastically over the past years says OConnor Weve seen a lot more acceptance and trust from people in recent years Our biggest donations are from the Irish public theyre amazing Visibility of Muslim women in Ireland is much better than years ago There will always be racial issues with all ethnicities but things are becoming easier Sabina Syed who has been an active member of the charity for nearly eight years says the group plays an important role in helping young Irish Muslim women feel confident about wearing their headscarves Apart from it being a charity my main concern was giving my girls the understanding that they can do whatever they want while wearing a hijab she says of her and daughters Growing up in a country where very few women wear a headscarf Syeds eldest daughter had plenty of questions when her time came to start wearing the hijab Before when I was growing up we were told to do something and didnt ask questions But now we have to explain the logic behind the scarf Her friends ask questions and she brings those questions back to me Now shes in a school where shes the only Muslim girl but the staff are very nice and she understands the logic behind the scarf Syed who moved to Ireland in says Ireland has grown up during her time here There was a time when I was scared to wear my hijab in the city centre that people would say things to me But since we started going out to the GPO were quite well recognised people smile at us We have shown that Muslim women can have a positive impact on this society We are doctors engineers teachers We can do anything we want with our hijab on its just a piece of cloth on our head Nikki Joyce a phlebotomist at Tallaght hospital who converted to Islam in doesnt wear a hijab in work yet Theyre not used to seeing me in it but eventually Ill get to the stage where Ill wear it She recalls how a young woman once asked why she was wearing a cloth on her head during the soup run I reminded her that nuns wore them and that her grandmother probably wore a scarf everywhere she went Its to do with modesty its nothing to do with oppression And for me its an identity thing You can see my face you dont have to see my hair and body Joyces two teenage children are Catholic but are interested in their mothers decision to convert I brought my children up to be very open and nowadays theres such a mix of kids in their schools theyre used to it Joyce was dumbstruck the first time she took part in the Friday GPO soup run I hadnt really done charity work before it blew my mind Its amazing the different types of hidden homelessness people may have a roof over their head but not enough money to eat The groups outreach work targets people from a whole array of backgrounds she says We focus on everyone from Billy the builder to Zainab the teacher This is what Islam is about its about giving back Nooraza Auckloo who works as a healthcare assistant in AE at St Jamess Hospital is helping hand out food with Joyce the night of my visit The pair have continued to volunteer over the past year despite the long stressful hours of working on the front line during the pandemic Every Friday morning Auckloo who has lived in Ireland for years drives from her home in south Dublin to Tesco where she picks up supplies for the evening When Auckloo first started helping out three years ago she admits there were ups and downs There were some people who would pass by and say Go back to your country That can break your heart because youre just trying to do something good But I know at the end of the day Ill be rewarded for my efforts Originally from Mauritius Auckloo usually takes a months annual leave to visit family during the summer However in when it became clear she would not be able to travel because of she arranged to take every Friday off for the year to help MSOE with the soup run I wasnt going home and wanted to do something with my time I live here on my own I dont socialise much but then I met some of the sisters through this and they became like family All week youre overworked when Friday comes I find this new energy OConnell is not surprised that the group has become a place of comfort and friendship for its members Weve all faced so many obstacles Its only in the past three years that it really feels like a game changer in Irish society Weve seen a lot more acceptance Thats the sheer determination of the women and the love they have for the work they do Its their determination to make people accept them for who they are What we do is a gesture of goodwill but its also letting people know were Muslim and were just like you

170,../data/sec_IRL/Irish Times/Factiva-20230807-165,Features Don’t say you’ when you mean I’ Your fiveminute therapy session The knowledge gained from psychotherapy can benefit everyone So why isn’t it taught in schools Joe Humphreys Wörter April      Starting a sentence with I is discouraged at school its frowned upon in journalism and when followed by an expression of feeling its traditionally problematic for men I am making amends today however having learnt from psychotherapy how avoidance of the firstperson singular can be used to interpose distance between ourselves and our troubled reality I should say I have been learning psychotherapy one step removed thanks to a delightful new book The Act of Living by clinical psychologist and novelist Frank Tallis Psychotherapy differs from philosophy or spirituality he tells me because the whole of this tradition stands or falls according to the willingness of individuals to actually put it into practice You only really get a feel of how useful it is if you say Okay Im going to try this for a week I dont think an intellectual understanding of it is very useful Tallis is keen to say Id never aspire to the mantle of a guru Instead he is seeking to act as a conduit for a massive body of knowledge that has been overlooked and misrepresented You have all these great thinkers over hundreds of years considering the issues we all wonder about Why am I here How can I live optimally and yet the face it presents the general public is either a rather empty and unappealing popular psychology or its just a bunch of competing schools instead of a coherent tradition There are some very practical tools people could learn from a young age he notes including how to interpret their own use of language how to make sense of their life story and how to appreciate their evolutionary needs including the need to be held psychologically or to feel a sense of security The latter has particular relevance in the context of the crisis Tallis says he has seen thousands of words written about the pandemic offering little in the way of advice on how to adjust to trauma The tradition Im talking about can give you an answer and a very practical answer You need to assimilate those memories you need to reestablish continuity of narrative The displaced event has to be reinserted in ones personal narrative Tallis explains further in a fiveminute therapy session or more accurately session about therapy as this weeks Unthinkable guest A motto of the pandemic is lower your expectations Do we need to build on that thinking taking on board Sigmund Freuds advice to embrace common unhappiness I think people are badly served by a culture of excessive positive expectation and one of Freuds great virtues was that he was a realist He accepted that there is only so much you can expect from life and to work within rational expectations and rational parameters and that is a good inoculation against perpetual disappointment We do live in a culture that has probably been massively influenced by a wave of humanist idealism particularly coming out of America where we are all encouraged to follow our dreams cultivate a view of personal potency and to aspire There is nothing wrong with wanting the best but it just has to be tempered by a sense of reality Just look at the modern mantras we are asked to flow particularly the young Follow your dreams Sure but a lot of people never get to realise their dreams for all kinds of reasons We are told to reach for the stars but a lot of people dont have the capacity or opportunity to reach for the stars in the way we are told One of the most pernicious is never give up As a mantra it makes no evolutionary sense The idea of not giving up and persevering blindly in the hope that one is going to have happiness or wealth or some analogue of evolutionary resources delivered is very poor advice We have to be flexible The messaging for men seems particularly problematic The strong silent type is still revered and it remains much more difficult to get men to talk about their feelings How can we make progress on that I think to some extent there is a problem in terms of the detail People are just told to talk about their feelings without necessarily being given very much instruction or help in how to do that and actually its a lot more difficult than you might think One of the things I explore in the book is how many of the great psychotherapists pay very close attention to language and how we can sometimes use language to distance ourselves from ourselves and from our own feelings Fritz Perls observed that we often distance ourselves by saying you know how it is or you know how you feel bad when really what I mean is when I am in this situation I feel bad Modern neuroscience has shown that when we use words like I rather than you when we use personal language patterns of activity are entirely different in the brain We are making ourselves more accessible to ourselves and therefore to other people This is where I think the whole tradition of psychotherapy viewed as a unified philosophical school can be instructive because it fills in some of the detail And I think it is the sort of thing that would make a very good syllabus in schools so that young men can be equipped to deal with their emotions How would you do that in a school setting Look at a body of knowledge and translate it into a language children can understand I mention in the book Freuds analogy that you can look at psychoanalysis like electricity Electricity is something you can use in a medical setting like a hospital but actually you can use it to power trams and do all kinds of other things with And the intellectual tradition of psychotherapy should be viewed in the same way We shouldnt see it as narrowly as something that is useful to treat mental illness or to treat people who have psychological problems We should see it as another great tradition along with philosophy or spirituality that is likely to appeal to a particular kind of person probably someone inclined to a materialist view of the universe someone who wants more practical answers that are based in neuroscience or evolutionary psychology some kind of scientific rooting That kind of person is likely to benefit from it the most I think its quite sad particularly as a professional myself and having spent a lot of time talking to unhappy people that a vast section of the public has a rather negative view of it as being either too mawkish touchyfeely or too west coast American or too psychiatric and too medical It is very sad because if you look at mental health statistics and you look behind those statistics generally to see the number of people dissatisfied and looking for answers sometimes desperately it would be useful to know there is this other tradition there One of the issues you explore in detail is how putting a narrative on your life can help overcome depression or trauma But how good a plot do you need Does my life story need to be heroic The issue is not so much how well it succeeds as fiction or event The issue is coherence What you find is that people who can tell their own story in a coherent way usually have better mental health than people who cant Its a curious thing the inability to describe ones own personal narrative is associated with delinquency criminal behaviour unhappiness Its almost like a prerequisite of mental health to be able to impose some kind of order on experience You dont have to have a dramatic story You just have to have a coherent story so your various aspects of identity are stitched together so you have a feeling of who you are The Act of Living What the Great Psychologists Can Teach Us About Surviving

Philip BoucherHayes is surely right when he says Mondays full reopening of schools will prompt a collective sigh of relief from teenagers and their parents True his suggestion that this exhalation will be so great that Met Éireann may detect atmospheric pressure changes is a bit of an exaggeration But while BoucherHayes the guest host on Today with Claire Byrne RTÉ Radio weekdays isnt one for understatement he calls mass online education a social experiment unprecedented in modern human history he also captures the mood surrounding the resumption of school Amidst the prevailing depressions and squalls of the pandemic any positive development isnt so much a breath of fresh air as a gale As a presenter BoucherHayes is always erudite and knowledgeable but his style can veer between the refreshing and the windy On Wednesday he talks to neuroscientist Dr Sabina Brennan about helping the teenagers in our lives manage the expectations stress and risk of living under lockdown which seems an ambitious goal given how most adults are muddling through But the discussion proves both absorbing and useful Brennan explains how the teenage brain has a neuroplasticity that brings incredible flexibility in terms of learning but also increased vulnerability to stress Similarly with the rational frontal lobes still developing teens rely on the emotional centres of the brain resulting in reflexive rather than reflective behaviours Brennans language is clear and accessible but her message is oddly reassuring presenting distressing adolescent mood shifts as a natural part of a biological process BoucherHayes is a receptive foil throughout though he also punctuates the chat with chortling dad humour Do teens need more sleep or are they just lazy oafs Not that the host dumbs things down If anything hes too keen to show off his own learning as when he claims that unlike adults the teenage brain is capable of multitasking Its quite the reverse Brennan replies I must have been multitasking at the point in time when I read that says BoucherHayes sounding only slightly chastened Its not the only time his naturally confident manner trips him up During an interview with epidemiologist Dr Gabriel Scally BoucherHayes takes issue with his guests advocacy for mandatory quarantine The number of cases linked to foreign travel is a fraction of a percent the host says its not the biggest problem When Scally responds that every case is linked to foreign travel because the virus and its subsequent variants all arrived from abroad BoucherHayes talks over him Yes but we are where we are Its a peevish exchange emphasising the fine line between grilling a guest and insisting on the last word Such moments are rare however His occasional intellectual overenthusiasm aside BoucherHayes has an admirable curiosity about how individual stories feed into a bigger picture as shown by Boom Bust Broke his recent documentary strand for Drivetime on the decade since the bailout Similarly Tuesdays conversation with paleoanthropologist and broadcaster Ella AlShamahi on the history of the handshake places personal experience into wider context to good effect BoucherHayes sounds fascinated as his guest outlines the origins of greeting but hes equally aware that the gestures universality is partly due to the dominance of western culture sidelining other expressions of welcome This isnt an academic issue for the host who has previously reported from the Middle East he asks if touching his heart and bowing is an appropriate greeting towards a Muslim woman in the region AlShamahi is duly impressed recalling that she never shook a mans hand until adulthood She also suggests the heart tap is also a sensible greeting for pandemic times Well it beats waving your elbow at people BoucherHayes replies As an item its breezy but thoughtful and informative much like the versatile host himself Lethargic air The impending return to school also features on The Last Word Today FM weekdays albeit refracted through the row over teachers losing their vaccination priority But despite the upset felt by teachers at their status being downgraded in the governments new agebased vaccination plan theres surprisingly little spark as Matt Cooper speaks to teaching union leaders Instead a doleful air pervades his interviews with ASTIs Eamon Dennehy and John Boyle of INTO While the officials are concerned about unvaccinated teachers in crowded classes Boyle also insists theyre not trying to jump ahead of the queue This diplomatic sensitivity to the public mood slightly undercuts their arguments as does the reality of the rollout The vast majority of teachers will get vaccinated when on holidays so it doesnt really make any difference Cooper muses Even the presence of ostensibly opposing viewpoints doesnt raise the temperature Neil McDonnell of small business group ISME is against industrial action but concedes that Dennehy makes a good case This lethargic air pervades other items A debate between Professor Anthony Staines and independent TD Michael McNamara on whether public health officials are scaremongering is short on friction Despite the participants differing views on future strategy both agree current policy is causing public weariness We are pushing everything onto the shoulders of Irish people but were not doing the other stuff says Staines Though Cooper conducts affairs in sprightly fashion the weary atmosphere seems to echo the countrys temper Its only when conversation again turns to the topic of young peoples psychological wellbeing that theres any urgency Alexandra Ryan of Gossie talks openly about her feelings of confusion loneliness and vulnerability during lockdown while expressing annoyance at the absence of younger voices at policymaking level Cooper for his part wonders if young people will go ballistic once they get a bit of freedom Ryan isnt entirely sure All this social anxiety has built up but cant help being optimistic I think it will be the best year weve had in a long time she says Moment of the Week Making the cut As Tom Dunne stands in for Sean Moncrieff talk on Tuesday he must wonder if hes there as some kind of punishment as hes landed with a notably stomachchurning bill of fare Theres regular contributor Graham Finlays report on nailbiting for one in which he outlines the dire consequences of

174,../data/sec_IRL/Irish Times/Factiva-20230807-165,Opinion Government treats religion like a whimsical hobby Breda OBrien Wörter April      Prof Oran Doyle of the Law and Human Rights Observatory has done citizens some service In a lengthy blog post he has untangled the labyrinthine regulations concerning religious services since lockdowns began It is alarming that it requires a professor in law of Trinity College Dublin to trace the tangled threads of legislation and regulation Doyle and his colleagues have been pointing out for nearly a year now and not just about religious services that there has been an unacceptable blurring of what is illegal and what is public health advice This has led he suggests to a governmental failure to lead citizens through the pandemic in a way that respects citizens autonomy and capacity for reasoned choice Since the latest regulation was introduced last Monday various Government Ministers have been falling over themselves to tell us it was not aimed specifically at religious services but instead at a variety of other outdoor and indoor events As Doyle states it is difficult to see that regulation accomplishes anything other than impose a criminal prohibition on religious services Furthermore it does so in a way that involves a bizarrely and unnecessarily convoluted scheme of legislative crossreferences Doyle speculates as to why it was not done much more simply He sees two possible reasons both centring on the accountability moment provided by Declan Ganleys legal challenge to the ban on public worship Legal basis The first possible reason is that the Government genuinely but wrongly in Doyles view believed there was a legal prohibition on religious services but accidentally deleted the basis for this view This happened when it removed the prohibition on leaving ones home without a reasonable excuse and replaced it with a prohibition on leaving ones county The Government had to move hastily to reinstate this legal basis on Monday night in the form of regulation Prof Doyle finds this reason implausible While entering a caveat about attributing motives he states that he finds it much more likely that the Government either had to create a legal basis for maintaining in court that religious services were criminally prohibited or accept that religious services had not been criminally prohibited The Government chose the former option The new regulation has led to anomalies where it is legal for a priest to meet a parishioner outdoors for a chat but it is a criminal offence for both if he meets a parishioner outdoors for confession As Doyle says now that it is clear there is a criminal prohibition on religious services it is time to look at whether it is proportionate He and his colleagues have primarily been concerned with the bringing of the law into disrepute by implying that certain things are illegal when they are not thus controlling people through a mixture of fear and moral pressure As a person of faith while I share that concern I am also appalled by the failure of the Government to act in a pluralist fashion At its best pluralism recognises that by and large religious and other philosophical worldviews are a good in society and foundational for those who hold them People should be allowed to live by them unless there is a very good reason not to Shred of understanding In a way the Catholic Church is a victim of its own failures in at least two ways First its egregious failures in the area of child safeguarding for decades has left it timid and lacking the courage to speak up The genuine desire to protect parishioners coupled with a less laudable desire to be seen as the best boy in the class has left the Catholic Church eager to be seen as cooperative and responsible The reward has been to be treated instead as irrelevant Second a significant number of the Cabinet were educated in Catholic schools and still do not show a shred of understanding of the significance of the Eucharist for Catholics much less religious services for Protestants or the need to gather in a mosque for the Muslim community Since the beginning of the pandemic religion has been treated as not only nonessential but almost as a whimsical hobby aside from rites of passage such as funerals and weddings both of which have secular equivalents This is despite the fact that faith communities have complied with every health and safety requirement in what are often unusually large public buildings The excuse originally was that since the majority of churchgoers are older it posed an unacceptable risk Now that virtually all older churchgoers are vaccinated what is the excuse Normally the Government worries about being out of step with the rest of the world According to ReOpen EU a website the European Union we are an absolute outlier in Europe when it comes to the strictness of the ban on public worship Funny how the Government scrambled to find loopholes in quarantine regulations for elite athletes Perhaps if people of faith were half as vocal about their convictions as elite and professional athletes they might not find themselves so irrelevant and invisible in the Governments eyes

Macron looks to May election Lara Marlowe Wörter Mai      One year before the French presidential election the most plausible scenario is that President Emmanuel Macron will win reelection after defeating the farright leader Marine Le Pen who was already his adversary four years ago But if there is a lesson to be learned from the last two decades it is that predictions in French presidential contests are more often wrong than right Macron has not had an easy time of it In France was rocked by the gilets jaunes or yellow vest protest movement That was followed by more unrest over Macrons attempt to reform the pension system and then the coronavirus pandemic France is now mired in three serious crises says the eminent political scientist Pascal Perrineau socioeconomic medical and what he terms a crisis of cultural values In the socioeconomic and pandemic crises voters can say Okay Macron hasnt been brilliant but would other candidates have been any better Probably not Perrineau says More seriously he points out the French no longer agree on what makes France Do we still believe in a republic organised according to the pact of laicité government enforced secularism Or do we accustom ourselves to a society in which various communities cohabit This is a profound debate an incredibly deep fracture about the very nature of France This fragmentation is felt most acutely in relation to migration Islamist attacks and Frances large north African Arab minority These issues will dominate the presidential campaign and were at the heart of three leading news stories at the end of April Thousands of people demonstrated all over France this week after the supreme court upheld a decision that Kobili Traoré a Muslim could not be held responsible for murdering his Jewish neighbour the retired doctor Sarah Halimi because he was delirious after smoking cannabis Traoré severely beat Halimi shouted Allah akbar and threw her from a thirdfloor window Macron asked that the law on criminal responsibility be reviewed On April Jamel Gorchène a Tunisian who entered France illegally but became a legal resident in slashed the throat of Stéphanie Monfermé a policewoman in Rambouillet southwest of Paris It was the Islamist attack against French police since and prompted renewed accusations that Macron is lax on security A Harris Interactive poll for LCI on April found that per cent of French people think violence is increasing by the day Civil war Twenty retired French generals lowerranking officers and close to French soldiers expressed outrage at the state of the country in an open letter to Macron published in the rightwing magazine Valeurs Actuelles on April The date of publication was pointedly timed to coincide with the anniversary of an attempted putsch against Gen Charles de Gaulle during the Algerian war and the anniversary of JeanMarie Le Pens qualification for the presidential election runoff France is unravelling the generals wrote They alleged that hatred between communities was fanned by a certain antiracism and Islamism and the hordes of the banlieue If Macron continued to dither they warned tomorrow civil war will put an end to the growing chaos and the deaths for which you will be responsible will be counted in the thousands Continued laxity would necessitate the intervention of our comrades on active duty they added Marine Le Pen qualified her support for the generals letter with the words I think these problems can be resolved by a political project that is validated by the French in a democratic framework In other words by voting for her in the presidential election On Wednesday the chief of staff of the armed forces Gen François Lecointre announced that signatories who were active duty officers would be disciplined The Harris Interactive poll indicated that per cent of the population agree with the message of the generals letter though a majority do not want a military takeover Le Pens support for the generals destroyed years of efforts to improve the image of the far right says PieyreAlexandre Anglade a deputy in the National Assembly for Macrons La République en Marche and spokesman for the party in the last European elections She has shown that she is exactly like her father She is from the antirepublican brutal extreme right he said Polls indicate Macron would win per cent of the vote in a presidential runoff against per cent for Le Pen That represents a gain for Le Pen and a decline for Macron since It has never been so possible that Marine Le Pen could win says Natacha Polony the director of Marianne magazine and a frequent commentator on French television A Le Pen victory is possible now because part of the left will refuse to vote for Macron in the runoff and because she no longer frightens some people The only certainty is people feel no matter what they do the same policies are always adopted This country is filled with anger resentment and frustration and when that doesnt find an outlet its very dangerous Polony agrees that the French electorate has always been angry but says this time is different The gilets jaunes movement was unprecedented People want to kill cops now which is new And people who have spent or years in France are taking up arms because they hate this country That too is new You cannot say its always been like this There is no means of structuring this anger Conservative Threequarters of the French electorate do not want a repeat of the MacronLe Pen runoff which could open the way for a third contender The French left is decimated so that candidate would almost certainly come from the conservative party Les Républicains The conservative former prime minister Edouard Philippe is the most popular politician in France at the moment Marine Le Pen is second most popular but politicians are always popular when they are out of power Polony notes Philippe will not challenge Macron That leaves the LR politicians Xavier Bertrand and Valérie Pécresse both presidents of French regions and Michel Barnier who negotiated the EUs Brexit agreement with the UK None of them has yet gained sufficient support to challenge Macron Benefit As he moves into election campaign mode Macrons advantages are four years experience at the Élysée and the weakness of his adversaries And he will likely benefit from Frances presidency of the EU in the first half of Presidents and prime ministers often stop reforming and transforming in the runup to elections Anglade says This French presidency of the EU is an opportunity for the president to remain active and in charge until the end of his term Anglade calls Europe a pillar of Emmanuel Macrons political identity He sees the € billion EU recovery fund which was pushed through by Macron and German chancellor Angela Merkel as one of Macrons greatest achievements And the EUs adoption of a common programme for the distribution of vaccines was the realisation of Macrons concept of shared EU sovereignty he says

but I find now it makes me emotional and happy and fosters a heightened sense of empathy writes Ruth Medjber Ruth Medjber Wörter Mai      Growing up with two strong parents is great they each impart their own wisdom and experiences When those parents are from different backgrounds cultures countries even thats when things get really interesting My Dad is Muslim and my Mam is Catholic Me Im an atheist As I was born and raised in Dublin it seemed very natural and convenient that we celebrate Christmas and Easter and everything in between I went to a Catholic school but mainly because there wasnt any other choice at the time When I announced in my teens that I was going to try to fast for Ramadan it was a little bit of a shock to everyone Ramadan is a big event in the Muslim calendar Its a very holy month during which followers are supposed to fast during the day So from sunrise to sunset for days nothing is allowed to pass your lips When I was a teenager I was curious about different religions the ones that werent being taught in my school including Islam I wanted to see what my Dad put himself through and what over a billion people around the world were doing every day of that month Ive always been interested in my heritage and my Dads culture Ive also always been fiercely stubborn and determined so a challenge like this seemed perfect for me I carried on doing the annual fast into my though my reasons had changed I was living in town having the typical college experience of nightclubs pubs and surviving on nothing but cheap greasy food When Ramadan rolled around each year it was an excuse for me to get my act together To refocus my priorities and almost have a little detox Now in my my reasons are slightly different again Im now searching for some spiritual solace a little bit of peace and maybe some control over my own life Much like when I walked the Camino or spent some time in Japan chanting with Buddhist monks Ramadan feels familiar Ive grown up with it In my family home its as normal as Christmas and it has always made sense for me to do both I guess this comes with being mixed race you always have a connection to both cultures no matter how different they are or what part of the world you live in Ireland can be a hard place to fast In Muslim countries things tend to slow down during Ramadan people avoid eating in public some offices have shorter working hours and there would be very few social events planned in daylight Here its business as usual My emails start pouring in at on the button There are deadlines to meet and Zoom meetings to attend Most people dont know what Ramadan is Theyre always shocked when I say I cant drink water or the delicious looking mug of tea theyre offering me no matter how much I want to snatch it from their hands I think I spend a significant percentage of my fasting month just explaining what Ramadan is to people but its something I enjoy doing so I dont mind Most of the time I can schedule my work as a music and portrait photographer around Ramadan However this hasnt always been the case and there was a period in my adult life where I didnt feel like I was physically capable of doing Ramadan The start date of Ramadan will change every year moving days or so backwards in the calendar When I was a young child it was mainly in the winter months When it fell on Christmas day we simply scheduled dinner to be at sunset about so we could all eat together In my Ramadan fell during the height of summer which is also the height of festival season for me I found myself tasked with the job of photographing some of the worlds biggest headline acts right as they walked on stage at sunset I hadnt eaten or drank water in almost hours Needless to say it didnt go well I collapsed one evening at Longitude festival and it became glaringly obvious that I had to choose between Ramadan and my career and for a few years I chose my career This year is a year like no other With Covid came the temporary hiatus of live music Suddenly there were no stages for me to shoot at sunset no festivals to faint at Everything was shut down almost overnight A full months later and my career is still paused and I have no control over when it is coming back I just sit and wait for the updates to leak When Ramadan came around this time with a start date in April I found the thought of doing it incredibly appealing For the first time during the pandemic I had something that I could have full control over That no matter what Government restrictions were put in place or changed at the last minute this was something I could set out to do and hopefully achieve When youre fasting you get an immense clarity of mind and you become a lot less anxious Normally my brain goes a mile a minute and Ive to do lists for my to do lists but during the month of Ramadan Im forced to slow down I simply dont have the energy to carry on working at my full maniacal speed In the mornings Im at my best having gotten up just before dawn to have a cup of tea and force feed myself something carby like porridge or Birdseye waffles in the toaster if Im just not bothered being healthy at that ungodly hour Then Ill try to sleep for as long as possible to minimise my daylight hours Ill get the dog walked before the sun gets hot and starts to zap away all of my hydration and then its emails or photoshoots while I still have some ability to focus figuratively and physically Soon all the calories are burned up and my brain has turned into mash potato mmm mash potato I have a little disco nap waking about two hours before sunset to get cooking The thoughts of getting a takeaway disgust me Me The person who happily orders a pizza for lunch and a Chinese for dinner My body is craving goodness and goodness it shall get All I can think about is food Petty emails worrying texts and the inane persecution of social media which usually sends my anxiety sky high are all far from my mind Replaced by a simple desire for broccoli One of the big practices of Ramadan besides fasting is charity Youre saving money by not eating two meals a day not to mention the snacks coffees etc and that money is supposed to be donated to those less fortunate Now heres the thing usually forced charity would be tough for me to swallow I believe charity should come from the heart But during Ramadan I believe that mine and others charitable donations are genuine You cant help but have a heightened sense of empathy for those in your world who have less When all you can think about is food your heart breaks for those who dont know when theyll eat next Here I am happily preparing to indulge my most random and lavish cravings today its Refresher bars as soon as the sun sets but my mind is with the people living in Direct Provision who never have the option to splurge on delicious treats Or to our homeless community who eat their hot meals balanced on the curb outside the GPO So while Ramadan does so much for me emotionally and spiritually Im glad that my little sacrifices might end up being some comfort to others My heart is emotional and happy I spend the days being grateful for what I have and nearly burst into tears when anyone does anything nice for me My will is stronger than ever which in turn boosts my confidence I feel great if not a little bit famished As I write this at my best thinking hour I have days of fasting left Ive already started planning what my Eid feast will look like My Dad is cooking his famous Algerian stew which Mam and I will probably pair with a glass of Guinness

life Róisín Ingle Wörter Mai      When Dermot OLearys instantly recognisable face appears on the Zoom from his home in Londons Primrose Hill I expect many things to feature in our conversation Well probably touch on The X Factor the monolith of a TV talent show he presented for eight years Hell surely have lots to say on navigating life as a celebrity having been famous for more than two decades Well definitely talk about him becoming a father for the first time to a son Kasper in the middle of a pandemic at the age of and about his childrens books and his Irish parents Seán and Marie who three years ago relocated from their adopted home in London back to their native Wexford What is slightly more unexpected is his clearly wellthoughtout take on the evolution of the Catholic Church BritishIrish OLeary it turns out is something of a poster boy for an inclusive version of Catholicism If they had any sense with declining vocations and worshippers in this part of the world the top Catholic brass would sign him up as a spokesmodel Stranger things have happened The springboard for our unexpected theological exchange is a man called Fr Arthur Barrow who OLeary cited as an inspiration in an interview he did at the beginning of his career When I ask about Barrow he tells me the priest was one of four rock and roll religious that were on the scene when he was growing up in Essex Fr Barrow now retired was a tall firebrand an uncle figure He remembers the priest first arriving to the tiny rural church where OLeary was an altar boy The matriarch of the parish told him I dont really like what you wear and Fr Barrow said Oh my dear I dont really like what you wear either but I am sure well get along fine and that set the tone Super cool people He still remembers the names of the other rock and roll priests Fr Armitage who rode a motorbike and was from the East End Fr Vincent who was Maltese and had a girlfriend and Fr Harrington and Fr OShea who were solidarity badgewearing priests just super cool people youd like to go for a drink with Unbelievable Barrow had pictures on the walls in his sacristy of The Life of Brian and a Dalí picture of Jesus that was considered blasphemous He always said you find your own rules and find your own path And that stayed with me You know we sell ourselves short sometimes with Catholicism but theres a lot of reason to be found in Catholic history Look at Thomas Acquinas For me its not like I look at Hindus in India and think those guys are going to hell Its just beliefs and for me my culture follows this and other cultures follow something else Being a Catholic reared in Britain is still a hugely resonant part of his identity You have to remember that being Catholic over here was different to being Catholic in Ireland it is almost a rebellious thing Being Church of England is being part of the establishment but being a Catholic you are a Fenian you are the other and being the other is always very attractive And now hes on a roll about religion and why its still an important part of his life I believe Jesus was a revolutionary and a rock star and also hes the kind of guy who absolutely would have his arm around someone at a Pride rally Hed be absolutely out there fighting for those guys so thats how Ive kept hold of my faith Evolving church He has a lot to say about the interpretation of Bible scripture and his issues with the conservative strain of Catholicism The church has to evolve If it didnt evolve wed still be talking about flat Earth theory and creationism the Catholic Church now accepts evolution It takes a while but we get there eventually I actually feel I have far more in common with friends of mine who would be liberally Jewish or Anglican or Sikh or Muslim The central message of all these faiths especially the Abrahamic faiths is love forgiveness and tolerance right So if you hold on to that and dont worry too much about dogma and realise those are tenets you want to live your life by then actually you can coexist quite happily with organised religion Id rather be in the fight to change it than turn my back on it I tell him that in this argument he has something in common with former Irish president Mary McAleese who is sometimes criticised for staying within the Catholic Church despite her disagreement with the more repressive aspects of the institution Its a such a waste of time he says There is so much injustice out there And the church can be such a force for good in terms of social action around the world that to tie yourself in knots about something that can be misinterpreted in scripture what are you talking about Just wake up Wake up and see whats out there Go and do some good Stop criticising people for the way they live Hybrid existence Growing up in Essex with his sister Nicola as the children of Irish parents meant a hybrid existence There were céilís in the front room and Mass every Sunday along with membership of that very BritishProtestant institution the Boys Brigade He commends his parents for their classic roots and wings style of parenting I was never talked down to I was always reasoned with My opinion was valued without being pandered to that went from everything to the politics we spoke about around the dinner table to religion They came over here from Ireland in the late without anything he says My dad was kind of selfeducated Seán OLeary started out as a labourer but studied for a business degree at night and then a masters Because his parents were from the postwar generation they never really had a choice They did what they could to provide for their family We owe that to them and Ill never forget that because my But he just found he could do that so thats what he did I feel very lucky that he enabled me to grow up in a world where I am able to make these choices and work hard and have opportunities Through childhood and in prepandemic times as an adult OLeary has beens a regular visitor to Ireland and is fascinated by the connections between the two identities that shaped him so much cultural interbreeding as he puts it He also acknowledges the resentments and jealousies and how in many ways the countries cant stand each other And yet the Irish and English are far more similar than they like to admit but there are definite differences IrishBritish relations What does he see as the main differences Its hard to answer that question without reverting to terrible stereotypes he laughs His wife Dee Koppang a TV and film director is Norwegian and he sees similarities between that country and the English Theres definitely a more reserved thing there He mentions time keeping as a big difference and has a funny story about a visit to Ireland by his Norwegian fatherinlaw when arriving late for breakfast OLeary introduced him to the concept of Irish time Hes a news junkie and a history buff and has this to say about IrishBritish relations in recent times Brexit notwithstanding I think Ireland and Britain are becoming closer Most people in England love the Irish anyway they dont understand them but they love them His take on how the country of his birth is evolving is a hopeful one Britain he says is kind of waking up to confronting its past That postwar immigration wave of Jamaican Irish and Indian communities are being far more talked about and appreciated and that can only be a good thing And its important because as a secondgeneration Irish person Ive talked to a lot of my friends who are second generation whether they are Jamaican or Sri Lankan or Indian Its really important that kids over here arent brought up to feel guilty for existing but also that they grow up to feel really proud of what Britain did in the second World War and be proud of Darwin and Shakespeare and Tim Berners Lee and Alexander Fleming but also acknowledging that a country cant be this old without having done both terrible and brilliant things They should have full chapter and verse about Britains involvement in the slave trade and also know about how Britain played a key role in ending the slave trade History is so grey and nuanced and its important that people talk about it Relentless bad news Dermot OLeary like many of us has mixed feelings about life during the pandemic On the one hand the relentless bad news was grim but the arrival of Kasper last June was a blessing as was being able to spend so much time with him for the first months of his life He and his wife Dee had been trying for a while to start a family Without getting too deep into it if you try for a while you do start to think about the alternatives and I think we would have always adopted or something Im not being flippant about that its a huge decision but I dont think wed ever have been childless At the same time it does not negate the fact that people who dont have children are really valuable members of society Theres an importance placed on having children Im not going so far as calling it a microaggression but there is a sense that having children gives you a purpose But having children is only one way you can contribute as a valuable member of society Its not the only way Though only a parent for months he says that it does alter your mindset and your goals and values We are still very ambitious people but with a small a I think its important that your kids see you doing stuff You want to show your kids that theyre not the most important thing in the world they are to you but not to everyone else Theres a whole world out there and they should embrace that and work out what part of that world they want to be in and how they can affect it in a positive way OLeary was a friend of television presenter Caroline Flack and made a moving contribution to the documentary about the life career and death by suicide last year of the former X Factor and Love Island presenter Regarding Flack he says It was tragic I think the rise in social media exacerbated it There was definitely an addiction to the affirmation she got from social media And no good can come from that But she was exceptional at her job She was doing the right job I ask him about how when so many including Flack are impacted negatively by fame he has managed to remain to this onlooker at least relatively sound and sane Its easier because Im a man he says Its definitely easier You are not subject to the same scrutiny It also helps he adds having a strong sense of who I am I am also older and wiser now and less of a dick You change with experience and I love my job and I feel very blessed that I am still doing it I love the diversity at the same time I have a lovely family and friends I feel very centred and rooted You have to live your life normally he says To a degree you have to surrender to it and not take it too seriously The first time you walk into your dry cleaners or your grocery store or wherever they go Youre that guy off the telly and then the second time you are just Dermot and you just live your life Its neighbourhood living Embrace your neighbourhood Dont go to places where you know youll be photographed Childrens fiction At this point as though to insert themselves into the conversation OLearys two cats start loudly caterwauling and scrapping It gives him an opportunity to discuss his childrens book series inspired by cats that he and his wife rescued a few years ago from an olive grove in Italy where the couple have a home The opportunity to write for children came after he wrote a wellreceived musical memoir The Soundtrack to My Life The latest instalment of his Toto the Ninja Cat series is out at the moment OLeary says he grew up in a house of books and laughter and was read Irish fairytales at bedtime His dads work helped kickstart his childhood writing career Dad had a big computer with lots of paper laying around and I used the paper to write stories on Id take them round to the neighbours in the village and knock on doors and try and sell this detective fiction for I always made a profit I didnt have any overheads after all I got a couple of bags of sweets out of it It was radio he was drawn to though as a younger man working his way up from being a runner on BBC Radio Essex in the late before making the move to TV and that breakthrough gig on Channel Big Brothers Little Brother Then came those careercatapulting years on The X Factor as the genial cheeky host being kind to contestants and interviewing megastars such as Britney Spears and Paul McCartney He is still in touch with its creator Simon Cowell Although Simon doesnt have a phone So I am in touch with his personal assistant a lot by email Shes doing very well These days he is a presenter on This Morning has a weekend radio show on BBC Radio and like everyone else on the planet a podcast People Just People The latter is run through his production company Ora Et Labora which is his old school motto and means work and pray We do the work and then we pray to God that its okay he smiles Hes moving house soon and will celebrate his second pandemic birthday on Sunday turning Ferry to Ireland His parents have only seen their grandchild Kasper once since he was born so he is looking forward to coming over to Ireland on the ferry to see friends in Dublin and drive down to Wexford to see his parents I tell him that author Marian Keyes who knows him describes him as an angel adding nobody has a bad word to say about Dermot OLeary OLeary got to know Keyes during his stint on Big Brothers Little Brother She was so wonderfully honest about the characters in the house and shes a great writer such a joy He is also a huge fan of John Connolly the novelist and former Irish Times journalist I cant read his books quickly enough hes so prolific I dont know how he does it A parent now and as he says ambitious with a small a OLeary would like to write more he has a few ideas hes working on Id love to do documentaries he says the kind that reflect his interest in history He has volunteered for years for the London Irish Centre and received a medal of commendation from President Michael D Higgins through that work You dont want to talk about it too much but it was a big deal to me My dad came over in the and would wake up at to study for an hour and then would get us up and he made all those sacrifices and that feels a million miles away from where I am now Its something Im very proud of n Toto the Ninja Cat and the Mystery Jewel Thief by Dermot OLeary is out now OLeary will be in

187,../data/sec_IRL/Irish Times/Factiva-20230807-165,Finance BMW boss charged up by excess pandemic savings Pandemic and switch to electric cars driving change at BMW Ireland says Kevin Davidson Michael McAleer Wörter Mai      The motor trade has reopened its glass palaces amid a revolution not just in the cars it sells but how theyre sold The shift to electric vehicles is upending automakers but its the rapid adoption of online sales and overtheair vehicle updates that will disrupt the way cars are sold serviced and even owned The Irish motor trade has coped surprisingly well with the pandemic While the first lockdown saw new car sales initially collapse the situation improved in the autumn with total sales for down per cent on The market to the end of March was down just per cent on last year before lockdown struck and per cent on the first quarter of Compared to other consumer sectors the motor trade has survived the pandemic with only minor damage As the economy unlocks many in the industry are now eyeing the socalled excess pandemic savings of consumers estimated in a March economic letter by the Central Bank of Ireland to be about € billion BMW Irelands Scottishborn managing director Kevin Davidson sees the potential for the brand to tap into that postpandemic savings pot Clearly in Ireland there are some sectors that have been very badly hit economically by Covid But if you look at where a lot of our customer base is theyre probably working in financial services or technology pharmaceuticals theyve been booming Davidson is full of praise for the way his dealers and their staff adapted to the new increasingly online environment What has impressed me is the speed of adaptation And I think what helps them as much as what helped us as BMW Ireland was that working digitally forces you to think more digitally Its bizarre in a way if youre in that space things become clearer And youre able to develop digital tools much quicker It begs the question as to whether too much investment and effort has been spent on the glass palace showrooms that adorn the outskirts of Irish towns rather than online solutions After all some new cars were sold up to the end of April this year all theoretically traded remotely without the need for shiny showrooms Theres no doubt probably going back maybe five to years we probably did overcook the physical investment But that was all about the brand standards it was done for good reason at the time I think things have moved on he says Clearly with the growth of digital I think probably the investment in physical facilities will be less but I dont think it will be nothing Davidson says customers will still want to go for a test drive and will need to have their cars serviced or repaired in a workshop Okay in the future when all cars are electric are cars going to be needing to be serviced Well possibly not But theyll need tyres and theyll need other replacement parts You might have things like large used car centres and handover centres so you might have fewer retailers but you might have bigger used car supermarkets If you look at what a lot of the big dealer groups are doing theyve developed their used car markets Davidson points to a pilot scheme BMW is operating in South Africa where basically the car maker does the transaction with the customer its an online sale The retailer gets a handling fee based on doing the test drive and handover And its going quite well But I still think there a long way to go before we would say thats a model you would roll out across the rest of the world So will the current dealer franchise model survive into the next decade The customer may dictate that Today the retailer still is the one who has a relationship with the customer As a further reassurance to dealers that the end is not near just yet Davidson explains that todays cars tend to stay on the road for up to years So even if the manufacturers dont produce any more new petrol and diesel models from that still means there will be vehicles on the road requiring traditional servicing and maintenance probably up to However in the interim another feature of the motoring world may change the nature of car ownership Many car companies predict vehicles will be provided via subscription services rather than ownership within the next decade Several already operate pilot schemes across Europe Davidson says that still seems some way off for Ireland with buyers preferring the traditional ownership model right now But I think that will change particularly as the younger generation seems to not really care about ownership theyre probably fine with usership We will see a subscription model in the future If you think about it because of remote vehicle diagnosis there is the ability to turn features or options on and off So technological options on cars can be bought online temporarily which lends itself to a subscription model But I think you have to step carefully through that You have to try it with the consumer to see if it works Its what is working in other industries why not automotive he says Back to the present and Davidson reckons the Government has coped well with the pandemic I would applaud the Government for the way theyve managed the lockdown I think theyve done that pretty well However he doesnt believe it is doing a good job managing the transition to electric vehicles Electric vehicles According to Davidson the commitment to having one million electric vehicles on the road by requires a solid partnership between car manufacturers and Government The car companies are backing the move with billions of euro in investment but the Government needs to create a roadmap to support the transition Uncertainty over changes to taxes and grants are very unwelcome amid this move to electric He was particularly irked by the announcement of cuts to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland SEAI grants for plugin hybrid electric cars from € to € and a cap on grants to allelectric cars priced over € Both are set to come into play from July I was very disappointed in that I actually thought the model that we had in Ireland the incentives that we had in place were brilliant They were encouraging people to move from internal combustion engine cars to electric cars I accept all the arguments asking why should people get such a big grant if they are buying such an expensive car I can get that but weve got quite a big job to do The Government have said that they want a million electric vehicles by But then at the same time theyve cut the grants I would ask the Government is that not a mixed message Davidson has also been critical of the recent changes to Vehicle Registration Tax VRT which hit larger diesel engines in particular He wrote to Taoiseach Micheál Martin before last autumns budget calling for the Government not to follow the proposals of the Tax Strategy Group when it came to adjusting the tax bands on diesel and petrol cars Davidson told the Taoiseach that replacing older more polluting cars with plugin hybrids and fullyelectric alternatives would be ideal but some consumers will still want to replace these cars with cleaner petrol and diesel engines in the interim Despite these calls by the industry the Tax Strategy Group recommendations were largely adopted in Budget Targets Davidson accepts that Europes politicians and their advisers probably have got electric car targets right When EU governments talked about bans on nonelectric car and van sales from auto makers initially said was the earliest realistic target date Now several major brands are on track to meet the earlier target at least for Europe The Irish Government targets set around are ambitious says Davidson The BMW Group is in a very good position to respect these targets The most important basic requirement for the breakthrough will be expansion of public and private charging infrastructure across Ireland BMW says about per cent of its market categories will have fullyelectric models available by A decade ago BMW seemed to have a lead over established premium rivals in terms of electric cars with innovative models such as the and Then its new electric vehicle pipeline seemed to stall Right now the brand seems more of a follower in the allelectric market I think its a fair critique Maybe the company wasnt per cent clear on the direction he says But thats changed I listened to a broadcast the other day from some board members And what they said was the greenest electric car on the planet will come from BMW He also notes the high number of plugin electric hybrids PHEVs in the current BMW fleet We were probably quicker out of the blocks with PHEVs If you look at our mix per cent of sales this year is PHEV or full electric which is way higher than our direct competitors So we probably have been more in that space I dont think weve been doing nothing I think we probably focused on the middle ground And the next three new cars were launching are allelectric cars Thats really exciting Since the BMW and we have increased the number of electrified vehicles pure electric and plugin hybrid in our lineup to models Two key innovation flagships will be on the road this year the BMW iX and the BMW The BMW will even be released three months earlier than originally planned Davidsons arrival in Ireland followed a restructuring of local operations Employee numbers at the head office in Dublin have been cut from to although six UKbased staff are now working on the Irish operation as well We had too many heads employees for the volume that we are delivering he explains I think we could go back to heads but we need to be selling to cars In BMW Ireland sold just over new cars The German carmaker had taken direct control of its Irish operations in with the division here leaning heavily on its UK counterpart for support Is it still worthwhile operating a whollyowned company here rather than appointing a local distributor I think there are huge advantages from being in the market but the market has to be the right size I think so long as the new car market is over youd have a national sales company he says Like many businesses Davidson reckons remote working in some form is here to stay BMW Ireland is moving to a smaller office space in the same building and Davidson will be commuting from the UK where his family lives Due to the rules on selfisolation after travel he currently spends five weeks in Ireland and five weeks in the UK office but he foresees operating on a twoweek basis as he did prepandemic That said he is also eager to enjoy some normal Irish lifestyle I did come to Ireland for the pubs as well But due to the pandemic I have been in just three pubs in months As we part company Davidson pulls up a photo on his phone a picture of himself as a young boy with one of his toy cars in a sittingroom in Stirling in Scotland his proud dad standing alongside An avid collector of Matchbox toy cars Davidson earned his pocket money on Saturdays working with his father who sold fruit from his vans direct to customers It also gave Davidson an insight to the circle of life in consumer markets His dads business died on the back of a boom in corner shops They in turn suffered at the hands of the highstreet supermarkets These then lost out to the outoftown shopping centres And now those are under threat from home delivery services not far removed from the sort of service offered by his father While the motor trade is entering a new era when it comes to customer service he reckons we shouldnt forget the lessons of the past CV Name Kevin Davidson Position Managing director BMW Group Ireland Age Lives Splits time between family home in UK and Irish residence in Malahide Family Three adult children and lives in UK with partner Donna who works for the National Health Service Interests An avid golfer and cyclist he is also a fan of horse racing soccer and rugby Something you might expect Davidson regards himself as both British and Scottish He left Scotland when he was so Ive been away longer than I was there But he says as with the Irish you never really lose your roots On the independence debate he thinks Scotland should remain part of the UK Something you might not expect Spent several years working for BMW Canada as head of its

188,../data/sec_IRL/Irish Times/Factiva-20230807-165,Features I think Ireland will be a turning point in our lives’ Algerian PhD students arrived at the height of the pandemic and went straight into quarantine Sorcha Pollak Wörter Juni      When Wafa Rougab and Islam Ben Adel arrived in Limerick in January the pair had spent nearly eight months waiting anxiously for the go ahead to board their flight to Ireland Both university graduates from Algeria Rougab and Adel are two of a group of more than Algerian students who were chosen to come to Ireland in to spend four years attending the University of Limerick while working on their PhDs We were supposed to come here in May but due to everything was put on hold and we studied online instead says Adel a graduate of English and theoretical linguistics It was very frustrating we just had to keep waiting and following the news We received the dates of departure one week before leaving and there was lots of paperwork to get done in the capital before then says Adel Getting around Algiers is noisy and difficult it was all stressful And I didnt have enough time to say goodbye to my parents or spend time with my friends Above all we were afraid of Covid and that we might come into contact with people who were infected But when we arrived in Ireland it finally felt like we had some support and relief For Adel who comes from the province of Bordj Bou Arréridj southeast of Algiers it was his first time leaving Algeria However Rougab who grew up further south in the town of Laghouat had previously lived abroad The daughter of an engineer Rougab spent three years as a teenager in Spain after her father was transferred to Tarragona for work She had also visited the country a number of times for medical appointments to treat her visual impairment My time in Spain shaped my personality I remember being really shy and didnt feel able to speak about my ideas or perspectives But in Spain I learned the teachers were there to listen and it really helped my confidence Spain is a very open culture people listen to you there Rougab learned at an early age to listen carefully and memorise school lessons because of issues with her eyesight a skill that stood to her through university Ive had that problem since my birth and in my primary school years I could never see the board I learned to rely on my ears Third wave of virus After completing her masters in literature and civilisation Rougab was selected for the PhD study abroad programme She was initially set to go to Jordan but then the spaces at the University of Limerick became available We didnt know anything about Ireland wed just heard of James Joyce But no other Algerian students had come here on the scholarship programme before When the students finally stepped on Irish soil in January of this year the country was grappling with its third wave of the virus Nearly people had been hospitalised for while more than were critically ill in ICU Another people tested positive for on the day of their arrival and the students went straight into days of quarantine It was a weird time to arrive says Rougab I wanted to go out and discover the city but I wasnt allowed go anywhere I was still grateful to be here The severity of the pandemic only added to the stress of moving country adds Adel We felt like we were going to this completely new world but when we arrived we were restricted to our apartments I wanted to meet Irish people but due to Covid there was little contact with others Despite the pandemic restrictions both students tried their best to interact with locals once they had completed their quarantine They were pleasantly surprised to discover most people were very welcoming I could sense the Irishness in things straight away says Adel I loved hearing the way people greet each other and express things I found that when I asked Irish people questions they answered with a huge amount of information When youre studying English you want to improve all the time but because were living with other Algerians our contact with the language was reduced adds Rougab She admits the first few months in Ireland have sometimes felt lonely I have to do everything myself here back in Algeria I was studying but I lived in my aunts house She was like a second mum she did everything That is a challenge Im an organised person but I didnt have to organise my life in this way before While Rougab has had an overwhelmingly positive experience as a Muslim woman in Ireland so far some of her classmates from Algeria have been less lucky Some of my friends did face racism because they wear the hijabWe all carry stereotypes which is normal but we should not generalise about minority groups On a personal level Ive had no issues but some of our group havent had the best experience Rougab has also faced the additional challenge of getting to know a new city without the full use of her sight When youre visually impaired you generally have a fear about new places but in order to face this fear you have to jump So straight away I went to new places to get acquainted with the area Im good at memorising places and have an architectural mind I focus on the details Im actually the best one of my friends at mapping a place Signposting The bright signposting in Limerick has been a huge help she adds Here in Europe everything is wellwritten with a good contrast of colours for words This is really helpful Plus Im not afraid to ask for help But I should emphasise this is not new for me I was born with this and Ive never seen it as a challenge Both students are excited for Ireland to open up this summer so they can really get to know the country and its people They hope once theyve completed their studies in three years time Ireland will feel like a second home When you meet and understand a person you can get inside a culture and understand their perceptions says Rougab This exchange will help us to see things from a different angle Ive missed gatherings with friends and families but I think Ireland will be a turning point in our lives for something better adds Adel Although were not Irish well always have that Irishness inside us now New to the Parish A series about the lives of recent arrivals to Ireland We would like to hear from people who have moved to Ireland in the past years To get involved email newtotheparishirishtimescom newtotheparish

retired She plans to perfect the art of doing very little Roisin Ingle Wörter Juli      Who the hell gives a damn apart from me muses Bibi Baskin Were talking via Zoom on the occasion of her retirement this week and with typical bluntness the woman who has been variously a journalist broadcaster writer hotelier and motivational speaker is questioning whether anyone should care Shes at home at the southwestern tip of Co Cork near the village of Crookhaven where she lives with two cats The house is in the middle of a field Nobody can find me which is rather nice she says Despite wondering if anyone gives a damn Baskin announced her retirement a while back on social media where from the response of her followers it seems some people very much care She had a Facebook group called Bibis Happy Place named after the book of quotes she released during the pandemic The Happy Place had subscribers who since last January have paid € each a month to see her nature videos and read her meditations on life Many of their subscriptions expired this month so she decided this would be a good time to stop working and launch a new phase of her life What prompted her retirement I longed to do nothing she says There is a skill I believe in doing nothing And when I used to give these motivational talks that would have been one of the things I covered when you do nothing it allows you to still the mind Western society has just created this default thing now even in lockdown that you must be busy all the time And its not good for you mentally or physically I intend in my retirement to do nothing I find it hugely exciting Doing nothing comes naturally to her She picked it up after leaving her broadcasting and journalism career to spend years in Kerala India where she ran an awardwinning hotel called t he Raheem Residency I like to say I went to India on a threeweek holiday and ended up staying years She returned to Ireland seven years ago I learned in India that its very important to do nothing I put myself to the test about this retirement thing I chose a week not long ago when I would frame the days when Id wake up by saying to myself you have feck all to do today Baskin what are you gonna do about it The first day I was a bit uneasy Come the third day I got my head around it And now I just cant wait Observing her on social media over the last few years I suggest her working life appeared so enviably flexible and full of elements shes passionate about youd wonder why shed feel the need to retire at all This was a response she got from some friends and family too she says I discovered when I first mentioned this retirement thing to friends and family and all of that that not many people had much of an idea about how I spend the day my life wasnt as easygoing as they thought I would always be on the hunt for the next bit of a freelance job you know the freelance article to write for a newspaper or to get on talk And so all day long I would be aware of whats going on in the world I dont need to do that anymore I realised I could be a lazy little lump or a big lump if I want to be For years of working in the hotel in India Id be up at five in the morning in the pitch black I didnt have to be up but I was so excited about the day ahead She is still up at four or five each morning I think I superimposed a discipline on myself that maybe in retrospect wasnt necessary And Ill be free of that now When I mention finances in retirement she says this was another reaction she had from people who worried whether she could afford it And my answer was what the fk does that have to do with happiness I havent made huge money anywhere in my life She recalls an Indian astrologer predicting her drastic change in occupation from broadcaster to hotelier two years before it happened He also told me madam you will never be rich but you will always have enough money to do The pandemic suited her reclusive nature She has seen four people since she did her latest motivational speaking engagement on March She lists them out My GP my acupuncturist my great friend who helps me with the garden and one other friend Religious divide Life was always solitary for Baskin growing up Protestant in her hometown of Ardara Co Donegal I grew up very much alone which doesnt mean at all that I was lonely she says Her father died suddenly when she was six I would suspect that I was a daddys girl but sure Ill never know Her two sisters were nearly years older than her Her Church of Ireland national school was tiny with only students From junior infants to sixth class she never had a classmate being the only girl in her class each year The isolation continued in terms of childhood friendships Growing up in the the religious divide was very much a thing in Northern Ireland and in the Border counties and certainly Donegal I tended not to go down the town to play with the Catholics that didnt seem to be the thing to do all of this reinforced for me the idea that being alone is the norm She doesnt need a lot of people or company around No I dont I suppose if you buggered off to India in middle age on your own and stayed there like I did it must show a certain degree of independence But I would like to meet more than four people in the next months Bibi isnt her real name She chose it while working in Germany as a young woman when a Polish colleague couldnt pronounce her actual name Olive When she came back to Ireland she began sending off very badly written articles to newspapers some with the byline Olive Baskin and some using Bibi The first one she got published in the now defunct Sunday Tribune had the byline Bibi so she kept the name going She moved into broadcast journalism presenting Evening Extra in the and became the first woman in Ireland to be given her own chatshow simply called Bibi She was so ubiquitous in Irish life at one stage with her soothing voice and bright red hair that she famously featured on Gerry Ryans radio show during a discussion on whether people would like to be buried or cremated when they die Ryan asked a caller where hed like to be buried The caller replied Up to me blls in Bibi Baskin She says she always found it hilarious Asked about criticism during her broadcasting career she says it stings She recalls being asked by RTÉ to bring a TV critic out to lunch so she chose Éanna Brophy of that other longgone publication the Sunday Press And when we were probably starting the second buidéal bottle Baskin is a fluent Irish speaker as you used to do in those days he asked Why did you choose me Ive written terrible things about you I said and I remember this so clearly because they were all accurate She doesnt get recognised anymore it was years ago I look very different but when ordering a taxi or asking for something in a shop to her astonishment people still identify her by that rich dulcet voice Over the years she worked in New York and the UK but aged she packed a couple of bags and went on that threeweek holiday where she ran the hotel and pursued an interest in ayurvedic medicine that had started in Ireland She had to adapt to life in India There were no other atheists and ladies dont swear in India she says for two examples But the country and spiritual traditions have had a profound impact on her life something she thinks was preordained when she first came across the Bhagavad Gita the sacred Hindu text aged in Donegal Retirement will be busy for Baskin Shell continue learning Spanish on the Duolingo app and will also learn to make dishes from that country while continuing to perfect the south Indian recipes she picked up from cooks in the hotel kitchen She played piano from the age of seven to and wants to get back to that Theres the garden to manage and she quite fancies trying molecular gastronomy Her very favourite thing to do is lie on her sofa for hours learning about new things but she feels she also needs to get more physically active as part of this new phase of her life Contentment When she was in India she says she was bad at keeping in touch with people so when she came home a lot of her contemporaries had retired to their cottages in west Cork or they werent around and I hadnt done anything to deserve reuniting with them As a result many of her friends are younger I dont know anybody whos older than me And sometimes thats a right pain in the arse But it is the way it is Her favourite poet and philosopher is the late John ODonohue As she contemplated retirement she read his thoughts on the thresholds we encounter through life He suggested asking yourself what am I leaving what am I about to enter Shell be next May and seems content She agrees that she is Where does this contentment come from One thing is the practice of acceptance In the Western world language can be quite aggressive You know Im going to fight cancer Im going to hold out to the bitter end Why does an end have to be bitter And why do we have to hold out when we should have given up earlier So theres an awful lot of that stuff and the opposite of that I think is the Eastern notion of acceptance For example maybe if I thought about it Id love to have more money but I accept that it is the way it is Before she goes back to her cats and her garden and her wide open donothing schedule I ask Bibi Baskin if she has any regrets in her life She has none If you live in the present moment which is part of my whole wellness cloak that keeps me warm what would be the point of regrets I mean if you looked back I suppose you could do a bit of planning for the future But I dont see myself doing that either Living in the now is a great place to be 
194,../data/sec_IRL/Irish Times/Factiva-20230807-165,Opinion The problem with loyalist bonfires Freedom of expression is not a licence for freedom to hate Emma de Souza Wörter Juli      Following a cathartic if fleeting reprieve in due to the coronavirus pandemic this year has seen the reemergence of toxic discourse around the Eleventh Night bonfires one of Northern Irelands most controversial subjects Sure as the sun rises the annual crop of contentious flaming structures again loom over our neighbourhoods risking life and property alike For weeks leading up to the Twelfth their imposing forms suffocate the streets before ultimately erupting into flame smoke and noxious fumes Draped in Irish flags political posters sectarian signs and even human effigies some of the burnings objectively blur the veil between cultural expression and abject bigotry Historically the Twelfth has burdened the peace process with considerable added strain with its proliferation of the unregulated territorial markers which routinely litter the region most often taking the form of anything from bonfires being erected at interfaces between Protestant and Catholic neighbourhoods to triumphalist parades deliberately marching in restricted areas to British flags clinging to lamp posts in shared communities This year like many before it the hundreds of thousands of Irish citizens in Northern Ireland will witness their national flag and cultural symbol smouldering atop burning pyres set alight in opposition to Irish heritage set alight by their neighbours The Tricolour One group of bonfire builders went to the considerable effort of painting hundreds of wooden pallets in the distinctive colours of the Tricolour so that the sacrificial altar itself becomes the national flag of Ireland borne solely to be burned to ashes Another adorned their structure with a Tricolour and celebrated the burning of this largescale symbol of the Irish nation as a familyfriendly event This must be called out for what it is an act of hate Some loyalist groups set fire to political posters featuring party members of Alliance Sinn Féin and SDLP right alongside signs reading KAT an initialism of Kill All Taigs a direct call for lethal sectarian violence This is not culture its incitement to violence It is hard to draw international comparisons the concept of publicly burning symbols and messages targeting people of Jewish Muslim or any other faithbased denomination would not be tolerated under any circumstances elsewhere in the United Kingdom and Europe such a barbaric act would be considered a hate crime Freedom of expression does not give licence to freedom to hate and cannot be used as justification for the burning of effigies and national symbols on bonfires in the North Bonfires can be a safe benign cultural expression but not when they promote violence put people out of their homes damage the environment and burn the national flag of ones neighbour Ones own right to cultural expression should not necessitate the oppression of someone else Many of the most contentious sites are in workingclass areas steeped in deprivation The months of scavenging for wood is often carried out by children and teenagers as is the actual construction of the bonfire which places these children at great personal risk Serious harm This past week saw a teenager in Co Tyrone airlifted to hospital after falling from a bonfire site In Portadown the collapse of a largescale bonfire placed all those in attendance including young children at risk of serious harm North Belfast emerged as a particular point of concern this year following the construction of an illegal bonfire at the Adam Street interface on Department of Infrastructure property Minister for Infrastructure Nichola Mallon sought to have it removed with the assistance of Belfast City Council contractors due to concern over community tensions However the Police Service for Northern Ireland PSNI declined its duties and refused to provide support and protection necessary for the hired contractors to perform their task This escalated to a lastminute judicial review brought by two Assembly Ministers to force the PSNI to assist The review was unsuccessful The PSNI cited loyalist threats of violence as the reason to not intervene this sets a dangerous precedent that violence prevails The period of the Twelfth costs the public purse millions of pounds each year in cleanup costs enhanced policing civil servants and the fire service Were these bonfires to be properly managed and monitored made free from sectarianism and positioned in a safe location these costs would be considerably lower As Northern Ireland teeters on the cusp of change these archaic expressions of antiIrish sentiment compounded with environmental damage and risk to wellbeing will do little to appeal to this regions growing middle ground Without substantial reform including the prohibition of sectarian hate speech calls for violence and the burning of flags and effigies we risk losing another generation of young loyalists to the pit of sectarianism and hate Emma de Souza is a writer and citizens rights activist 
196,../data/sec_IRL/Irish Times/Factiva-20230807-165,Opinion Secularism is doomed without spiritual wisdom Globally we live increasingly in a truthless and ruthless age Fergus OFerrall Wörter Juli      It is becoming increasingly clear that secularism as a public creed in the western world has failed to answer the deepest needs of human beings and of society in general Indications of failure are evident in rising levels of mental distress loneliness social exclusion racism the assault on truth the decline of trust in democracy an erosion of decency all combined with a widespread malaise and fear of the future stemming from existential threats of such as the climate crisis Despite the freedoms enjoyed in this age of expressive individualism many are experiencing meaninglessness in their lives However the pandemic crisis revealed the human values based upon our diminishing spiritual capital which are essential to survive and flourish I suggest as we now seek to build back better that the spiritual wisdom embedded in our religious traditions when brought into constructive encounter with secular worldviews is a necessary if not a sufficient ingredient in shaping better public policies for a flourishing society A secular progressive framework requires to be informed by spiritual wisdom Given the strong public reaction to the gross failures of institutional religion it is easy to dismiss the more profound wisdom that is common to Christianity Islam and Judaism wisdom and insights that we need now more than ever This would be a grave mistake and would greatly impoverish our lives and our future Human beings are spiritual beings who seek meaning Secularism fails to provide an explanation a big story that gives meaning to existence Secularism has no anchor for ethics you cannot develop a meaningful morality out of a meaningless universe The results are evident in the amoral game of winnertakesall which dominates international relations as authoritarian regimes now govern much of our planet and threaten democracies Vacuum of secularism Xenophobia racism and gross inequalities combined with a disregard for dignity and human rights thrive in the vacuum left by secularism Globally we live increasingly in a truthless and ruthless age Secularism fails on the score of expectation it offers no guidance on human values save personal aggrandisement It fails to answer one question what are we to live for It also fails the test of empowerment so many now feel their lives are dominated by unseen forces fate chance or global corporations One might also say that secularism displays a failure of excitement No one sings songs or holds celebrations each day or week about a secular creed The launch by Taoiseach Micheál Martin last April of a Centre for Religion Human Values and International Relations in Dublin City University underlines a new awareness of the key role of religions in addressing our pressing global issues The centre is under the direction of former ambassador Philip McDonagh who also coauthored its founding manifesto the book On the Significance of Religion for Global Diplomacy The centre will develop proposals for new forms of engagement between public authorities and religions Jacque Delors as EU Commission president sought for religions to give a soul to Europe His thinking has borne fruit in the open regular structured and transparent dialogues with churches religious associations philosophical and nonconfessional organisations Structured dialogue These take place under article of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union at a highlevel with the EU Parliament Commission and Council In Ireland there has been a less successful attempt by successive governments to initiate a similar process Following his hopes for a new covenant for the century between church and State expressed at the welcome for Pope Francis in Dublin then taoiseach Leo Varadkar organised in Dublin Castle in July a structured dialogue It involved representatives of the churches faith communities from different religions as well as bodies such as Atheist Ireland and the Humanist Association in dialogue with the government Varadkar stated that in a participatory democracy there is a need for regular dialogue with churches faith communities and nonconfessional organisations the model of the EU was clearly in mind in his ambition to promote a pluralist democratic society rather than one based as he said on absolute secularism The common spiritual wisdom shared by our religions concerns values and meaning human dignity relationships solidarity hope peace justice equality the common good These ingredients of human flourishing are needed more than ever at this critical and dark time and ought to be brought into regular open transparent and respectful dialogue with those who espouse secular viewpoints as we all seek to rectify our current distresses Dr Fergus OFerrall was lay leader of the Methodist Church in Ireland His review essay The Inflection Point on issues raised here appears in the June issue of Dublin Review of Books drbie

198,../data/sec_IRL/Irish Times/Factiva-20230807-165,Ireland How Israel uses NSO’s Pegasus spyware as diplomatic calling card Clandestine cooperation offered to UAE Bahrain and Saudi Arabia Mehul Srivastava Wörter Juli      At the height of the coronavirus pandemic Naftali Bennett then Israels defence minister came up with an idea to help contain the spread of the disease let the military spyware manufacturer NSO track down his fellow citizens every movement The suggestion from the man who is now Israels prime minister did not pass muster But it shows the close ties the Israeli company assailed by rights activists for selling a militarygrade surveillance software to repressive regimes has with the highest echelons of the state NSOs Pegasus software which requires a government licence for export because it is considered a weapon has in recent years become a crucial part of Israels diplomatic outreach a role that has come into focus after the revelation by a consortium of newspapers that it had been traced to the mobile phones of journalists lawyers and political activists The software surreptitiously turns phones into listening devices while unveiling their encrypted contents From the Israel used its weapons sales for diplomatic gains the only thing that changes is the names of the countries said Eitay Mack an Israeli human rights lawyer who has tried for years to have NSOs export licence cancelled The question is if there will be some change in the exports policy While the recent news media leaks on Pegasus sparked international outrage the criticism in Israel has been muted The reporting looks tendentious with a commercial motivation said politician Yair Golan a former deputy military chief jumping to NSOs support in a televised speech It is not just NSO that does such things The ministry of defence which must approve every licence to export the weaponry said that appropriate measures are taken if any violations of the export licence are proved NSOs cofounder and chief executive Shalev Hulio denied the consortiums findings which allege that NSOs spyware has been regularly used on members of civil society opposition leaders and people with no connection to terrorism or crime We are claiming very vocally that these are not Pegasus targets or selected as Pegasus targets or potential Pegasus targets This has no relation to any customer of ours or NSO technology he told the Financial Times vowing to shut down any customers systems that are proved to infect devices belonging to journalists or members of civil society NSO has said in the past that it does not have access to its clients targets Hulio said the company had queried each one of its clients individually to reach that conclusion Gulf countries In recent years Israel has wooed Gulf countries such as the United Arab Emirates Bahrain and Saudi Arabia into improving bilateral relations by offering clandestine security cooperation against shared regional enemies from the Muslim Brotherhood to Iran As the countries grew closer groups such as Amnesty International and the Citizen Lab have tracked increasing Pegasus intrusions into the phones of journalists dissidents and activists across the region Its like the toy that every intelligence officer wants said a person involved in pitching NSO products in the Gulf They love the demos they love that it is from Israel Similarly Pegasus attacks have been documented on critics of the governments of Hungary India and Rwanda as former prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu pursued alliances with their rightwing leaders Israel has for years ignored calls by a UN rapporteur on the freedom of expression and others to place a moratorium on the sales of spyware and to regulate it more closely NSOs chief executive pushed back on any suggestion that the companys products had been leveraged by Israel abroad We are not a tool for diplomacy for the Israeli government we are a commercial company our shareholders are UK private equity said Hulio referring to Novalpina Capital Those allegations are just theories Those who have fought against NSOs influence in Israel say the company enjoys strong support from Israeli legal and political circles An Israeli judge imposed a gag order on Mexican rights activists so that their lawsuit against the company could be heard in secret A judge with a long background in military intelligence is overseeing a case brought by a Saudi dissident and friend of the murdered Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi The friend claims NSO was aware of his own phone being targeted The judge has declined to recuse himself despite declaring a prior relationship with NSOs lawyers The impression that I get is that the government is eager to help them especially when it comes to keeping the discussion away from any public scrutiny said Alaa Mahajna the lead lawyer on both lawsuits The companies should be held liable for the dangerous technology they sell but the most efficient way is prevention and unfortunately only the ministry of defence can do that Hulio declined to comment on the continuing cases NSO said These issues have previously been brought up in court cases against NSO and others and the courts have never accepted this stance For its part NSO has made no secret of its ties to the Israeli government In its lawyers argued in a court case that revealing its list of clients will meaningfully harm the foreign relations of the state In a separate filing the company has also said the Israeli government itself uses NSOs technology Many of its staff are from elite military intelligence units Western advisers NSO has hired big name western advisers including Tom Ridge the former secretary of US homeland security and briefly Juliette Kayyem an assistant secretary in the same department Its current PR offensive is being led by the exchief censor of the Israeli military Sometimes the Israeli government has intervened to direct the companys sales said two people with knowledge of the issue especially after highprofile scandals such as when Saudi operatives killed Khashoggi in Istanbul in October NSO initially halted a contract with Saudi Arabia amid allegations its technology had been used to track Khashoggi and his associates But in it renewed the contract with the Israeli governments full approval said two people with knowledge of the issue There was direct encouragement to keep this relationship alive said one who added that NSO employees returning from the Gulf were often debriefed by Israeli intelligence NSOs Hulio denied such briefings took place Often the Israeli governments links have been more public After a dam collapsed in Brazil in January killing hundreds the government dispatched NSOs Hulio who is a reservist in the searchandrescue unit of the Israeli military as part of its aid mission I travelled there as part of my reserve duty I am proud of what I am doing and it has nothing do with NSO he said Hulio showcased how NSOs software can also be used to triangulate the locations of mobile phones down to the last centimetre according to people familiar with his trip Israel has certain diplomatic goals and its interests and the interests of these commercial companies can sometimes dovetail said Shay Aspril an author and investigative journalist who first exposed NSOs secretive technology in The Israeli public does not fully understand what is going inside high tech the holy cow of the economy and because the Israeli public is not really concerned there is no public pressure on the government

205,../data/sec_IRL/Irish Times/Factiva-20230807-165,Features Migrant teachers struggle to get jobs despite school vacancies About one in students is from a minority ethnic background but this is not reflected in teaching profession Peter McGuire Wörter September      In all the misery that the pandemic heaped on to schools postprimary principals have been struggling to recruit the right teachers for the right roles Despite this migrant teachers say they have had issues securing jobs in Irish schools and so this year theres been a big focus on removing red tape for outofState teachers But is it moving fast enough to address the supply issues Latest available figures show about one in students is from a minority ethnic background but this diversity is not reflected in the teaching profession where about one per cent of primary teachers and two per cent of postprimary teachers are not from white Irish backgrounds Tomás Ó Rúairc director of the Teaching Council says that it is important for schools to have a more diverse teaching staff Children from diverse backgrounds should see themselves reflected in the teaching profession A diverse profession offers a range of role models Equal access to the profession must be assured as a matter of equity and this also widens the pool of candidates for teaching We receive approximately applications annually from teachers who qualify abroad Dr Garret Campbell is project manager of the Migrant Teacher Project MTP at the Marino Institute of Education in Dublin one of the main training colleges for primary teachers Working closely with MTP founder Dr Rory McDaid who carried out much of the initial research on recruitment and retention of migrant teachers the project helps primary and postprimary teachers who were educated outside of Ireland to secure work here Migrant teachers are teachers who qualified in their own country and they may be from Europe or outside of Europe says Campbell Our role is to help them navigate the requirements for teaching in Ireland and to provide support through a number of dedicated programmes There are several main barriers facing migrant teachers who want to work here Registration Teaching in Ireland is a profession regulated by the Teaching Council says Campbell The whole area of teacher induction has changed dramatically in recent years Occasionally there can even be Irish teachers who have done online teacher training elsewhere but there is a strict set of requirements and standards including what type of education primary and postprimary teachers receive as happens in other countries too Campbell says the Teaching Council can and should have professional standards Some prospective teachers however may be unfamiliar with certain terminology so the MTP is building a portal to help migrants understand exactly what documents and information they need to register We are saying that applicants may need to spend some time pulling together the relevant documentation says Campbell Once they have done that the process is relatively straightforward but there can be problems if for instance the institution in which they qualified has closed down or is not functioning One requirement at primary level is for all teachers regardless of where they trained to be able to teach through Irish For migrant teachers who did not train in Ireland this is doable but it takes about three years and they need to do an exam at the end of it says Campbell If they work on basic Irish and spend time at the Gaeltacht they can pass and there are a handful who are doing this every year Religion and historyMigrants are more likely to opt for postprimary teaching because the registration process is easier One of the courses run by the MTP brings aspirant teachers up to speed on the history of Irish education and at primary level at least how it is dominated by religious primarily Catholic school patrons Teachers need a Catholic Certificate in Religious Education to teach in almost per cent of schools or a Church of Ireland Certificate for just under six per cent of schools This means that unless migrant teachers are Catholic or Protestant or willing to pretend to be they are excluded from teaching at primary level Campbell says that the majority of migrant teachers look to work at secondlevel but whether this is because many face a religious barrier to working in Statefunded schools is unknown Diversity So what are the solutions The Teaching Council consults and liaises regularly with the Migrant Teacher Project says Ó Rúairc This includes annual seminars and monthly meetings for individual queries This is a very open channel of engagement which will continue to be enhanced in the months and years ahead We also are collaborating closely with the Department of Education in the Teaching Transforms promotion campaign The current phase of this campaign has seen a particular focus on diversity in the profession We have accredited postgraduate programmes of initial teacher education with blended modes of delivery The MTP runs a bridging project to support migrant teachers and give them a chance to reflect on the Irish school system engage with representatives of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and meet with school principals A new network has brought together about three dozen schools who are willing to give migrant teachers a shot and another event is being planned this month heightened the teacher supply crisis As a result the Teaching Council has decided that on an exceptional and timebound basis teachers who have qualified abroad can complete their induction in Ireland if they apply no later than October 
206,../data/sec_IRL/Irish Times/Factiva-20230807-165,Opinion Continued chaos seems the only certainty in Afghanistan Internal challenges to the capacity of the Taliban to govern may be exacerbated by economic and humanitarian challenges Vincent Durac Wörter September      The rapid takeover of Kabul by the Taliban on August and the demise of the previous internationally recognised government have confronted Afghanistans new rulers with deepseated problems The capacity of the new regime to govern effectively while responding to endemic economic and humanitarian crises has already been called into question In particular doubts have been cast about the internal coherence of the Talibans leadership and the strength of possible challenges to its governance Even before the Talibans ascent to power Afghanistan faced enormous humanitarian challenges including forced displacement due to conflict rising poverty levels severe food insecurity the persisting impact of the pandemic and a regionwide drought In there were million foodinsecure Afghans out of a total population of million With food supplies running out the World Food Programme has expressed fears that millions might be on the brink of starvation Prior to the Taliban takeover people were internally displaced while UNHCR reported the largest ever refugee movement across the border into Pakistan The humanitarian crisis and the scale of the challenge now faced by the countrys rulers have been deepened by the response of international actors to the Talibans accession to power Prior to this months events per cent of the Afghan governments million budget was provided by donor funding In the meantime the US Federal Reserve has frozen the countrys foreign exchange reserves of around billion The International Monetary Fund has suspended payments to the country as has the Asian Development Bank while the World Bank together with other donors has suspended disbursements of money for reconstruction Alternative resources to support the running of the country appear limited by comparison Apart from opium production on which many Afghans depend and which the Taliban is committed to suppressing the countrys exports in amounted to just million According to a recent UN report the Taliban itself has enjoyed revenues of between million and billion per annum largely the result of drug trafficking opium production extortion and kidnapping for ransom as well as mineral exploitation and tax collection in areas under its control and external support from wealthy individuals and charitable nongovernmental organisations The shortfall is likely to lead to further limits on state capacity to meet basic needs and a deepening of the economic and humanitarian crisis Internal divisions The capacity of the Taliban to govern effectively is also threatened by challenge within the movement and within the country The recent announcement of an interim government disappointed those who hoped for some reflection of recent Taliban commitments to greater inclusivity It also appeared to reflect a concern on the part of the movement to demonstrate its unity and coherence The new government is composed entirely of men entirely of senior leaders of the Taliban and almost entirely out of members of representatives of Afghanistans Pashtun community which comprises less than per cent of the countrys total population However the vocal rebuttal by Taliban spokesmen of speculation regarding internal divisions and infighting have been belied by the need in recent days to reject claims that the deputy prime minister Abdul Ghani Baradar had been killed in a shootout with opponents or to explain the disappearance from public view of its leader Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada Badly needed resources Internal challenges to the capacity of the Taliban to govern may be exacerbated by economic and humanitarian challenges in another crucial way The movement has sought to display a willingness to engage with external actors in order to attract badly needed resources In doing so senior Taliban figures have been at pains to demonstrate the extent to which the movement has changed since it first took power in Afghanistan in However the price of support from outside may be destabilising for the movement as it invites the possibility of challenge from more extreme Islamic militant organisations especially the socalled Islamic State Khorasan or ISK The departure of the United States has created an opportunity for other powers to exert influence over the new rulers Russian president Vladimir Putin was quick to declare that the Taliban takeover was a reality that Moscow had to deal with while Russias UN representative hailed the prospects for national reconciliation and an end to violence in Afghanistan In more concrete terms it has been reported that China is willing to spend vast sums of money to finance the reconstruction of Afghan infrastructure However support from any of these quarters will come at a price Russian support would be conditional on the Taliban taking action against Islamist militants in central Asia While the Taliban maintains its practice of denying the presence of foreign fighters the UN estimates their number at between and the majority from central Asia China for its part has concerns regarding the East Turkestan Islamic Movement ETIM composed of Uighur fighters opposed to Chinese repression and its detention of nearly one million Uighurs and other Muslim minority peoples The UN estimates that around ETIM fighters are based in the region of Afghanistan that borders China The difficulty for the Taliban is that action against any of these groups could have a negative impact on internal unity and might also drive recruitment to even more militant groups that are hostile to what they see as the Talibans narrow nationalistic and ethnic ideology Most prominent among these is ISK an affiliate of the socalled Islamic State ISK emerged from elements in the Pakistan Taliban who fled major antiterror operations carried out by the Pakistani military after After a period of fragmentation increasing numbers of these declared their allegiance to Islamic State and their opposition to the Afghan Taliban whose commitment to operating within the countrys borders as well as its recognition of international bodies such as the UN stood in contrast with the asserted universal ambitions of ISK to work for the establishment of a global caliphate By the two movements had declared war on one another In the course of hostilities ISK suffered territorial losses and is now reduced to a core of between and fighters But it remains a significant threat to stability According to the UN it has adopted a decentralised cell structure concentrated in urban areas and despite its relatively low numbers has carried out high casualty attacks which have targeted Western NGOs Shia religious centres hospitals and schools In the first four months of this year it carried out attacks as well as the suicide bombing on August at Kabul airport that killed US troops and at least Afghan civilians The return to power of the Taliban clearly brings with it a great deal of uncertainty What is almost certain however is the prospect of prolonged political instability and violence for Afghanistan and its neighbouring region Vincent Durac is associate professor at the school of politics and international relations University College Dublin 
208,../data/sec_IRL/Irish Times/Factiva-20230807-165,no section Irish Christianity’s rise and fall from grace Derek Scally Wörter September      Independent TD Mattie McGrath sparked uproar when he compared Ireland its pandemic restrictions and vaccination regimes to the early political regime of Nazi Germany Listening in from the land of the Nazi perpetrators I wondered why he was reaching so far for his farout historical comparison If you view Irelands regime as draconian arbitrary and discriminatory why not compare it to the glory days of Catholic Ireland Perhaps because as it vanishes over the horizon we still have no social consensus over how we remember what our country once was One section of Irish society denies Catholic Ireland was as bad as it is portrayed by the second group which disowns ever being there while a third and younger group looks on at a detached distance This is the reality gap into which Prof Crawford Gribbens new book steps The Rise Fall of Christian Ireland is an ambitious academic attempt to condense years of history into pages with additional pages of footnotes and a bibliography Perhaps the greatest miracle of Irish Christianity is that it took root at all on this isolated island at the end of the known world The earliest Christian settlers the Irish believing in Christ to whom Pope Celestine I sent Palladius as bishop in found in the island dwellers a people whose old beliefs were strong because as Gribben points out they made sense of the Irish situation But how to preach a new religion communicated largely in Latin a foreign language to an illiterate people who had never before seen a book That locals came on board by choice not force was through a successful synthesis of old and new Aside from its spiritual message Christianity went mass market because it offered greater opportunities wealth education trade than what went before Ironically modern Irelands druids who insist the early Christian church suppressed Celtic spiritual beliefs have the early Irish Christian monks to thank for recording much of the Celtic spiritual traditions they now follow today Despite beginning four centuries late Irelands religious women and men caught up quickly and were soon producing worldclass theological and scientific writings As the Roman empire christianised under Constantine collapsed Irelands protective Christian bubble thrived By the so many Irish monks were now fanning out to rechristianise Europe that Heiric of Auxerre a French Benedictine monk complained that almost the whole of Ireland is migrating to our shores with a herd of philosophers Back in Ireland Christianity survived subsequent hostile centuries by being a genuinely incorporating body Gribben argues and one of the few common denominators among an increasingly diverse population Even Sigtrygg Olafsson the NorseIrish King Sitric converted to Christianity made a Roman pilgrimage and vowed on his return to make Dublin a spiritual capital That the Reformation failed in Ireland with just Irishborn Protestants at the end of the century was attributed later by Catholic bishops as proof of their flocks unshakeable belief in the one truth faith Gribben sees other reasons such as the Church of Irelands spectacularly poor salespeople It took years after Martin Luthers theses before the established church produced its own localised sales pitch The Irish Articles by which time competing Presbyterians were already gaining ground The second half of Gribbens story highlights the whatmighthavebeens of Christianity in Ireland almost a decade of selfgovernment under the Catholic confederation until and the creative Christian chaos amid the bloody Cromwell years when Ireland embraced charismatic child preachers and the cure for death discovered in Stradbally Co Laois As the story reaches the modern day the narrative achieves a Reeling in the Years pace that favours breadth over depth Key events of Irish Christian history the Synod of Thurles and the Eucharistic Congress of are mentioned only in passing The Marian apparition at Knock in gets one sentence and the landmark papal visit a century later three Curiously Fr Michael Cleary gets a whole page Gribbens repeated insistence that Christian Ireland is dead will jar with some given that twothirds of the population still identify as Catholic if only culturally That just a of the papal visit numbers turned out for Pope Francis is astonishingly low he argues Seen another way given the revelations of the previous decades it was astonishingly high In the books final section Gribben says that Christianitys expansionism had ruined the teachings of Christ even before they arrived in Ireland Abuse survivors and their allies may nod but given the undeniable achievements of Catholic religious in Ireland in healthcare education and more some may find overly harsh his conclusion that failure has marked the entire history of Christian Ireland

Oktober      Saudi Arabias foreign minister has said the kingdom is serious about talks with Iran signalling Riyadhs desire to repair relations between two rivals that accuse each other of stoking tensions and instability across the Middle East A Saudi official added that Riyadh was considering allowing Iran to reopen its consulate in the port city of Jeddah but said the talks had not made sufficient progress to restore full diplomatic relations something Iran has been pushing for The kingdom has held four rounds of talks with Iran since April including a first meeting last month with the government of new hardline president Ebrahim Raisi The negotiations reflect a tentative deescalation in the region in the wake of the election of US president Joe Biden and with the economic hardship wrought by the pandemic In a rare interview Prince Faisal bin Farhan alSaud the Saudi foreign minister told the Financial Times that the talks with Iran had been cordial while describing the negotiations as exploratory We are serious about the talks he said For us its not that big a shift Weve always said we want to find a way to stabilise the region Riyadh and Tehran which claim leadership of the Sunni and Shia Muslim worlds respectively cut diplomatic ties in January after Saudi Arabias embassy in the republic was ransacked The diplomatic mission was attacked after Saudi Arabia executed a senior Shia cleric Riyadh believes negotiations have not yet made sufficient progress to restore full relations with Tehran But a Saudi official said it was considering an Iranian request for it to open its consulate in Jeddah Riyadh was also considering allowing Tehran to reopen its representative office for the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation in the port city However the kingdom was not yet ready to reopen a consulate in the Iranian religious city of Mashhad with a senior official saying the dialogue so far lacked substance Nuclear deal The discussions have been taking place amid European diplomatic efforts to broker a deal on Washingtons return to the nuclear deal Tehran signed with world powers in Talks have stalled since Raisis election in June The Saudi official added Tehran was focused on signalling Especially to the west they are signalling that look we have resolved our issues with the Saudis and any lingering things we can work out together so dont talk to us about regional security he said Treat us like a normal country and lets do this nuclear deal Raisi a protege of Irans supreme leader took over this year from the centrist president Hassan Rouhani the architect of the nuclear deal The Saudi official said Riyadh always had the philosophy we want to speak to the real decision makers That is why in the previous government it was pointless speaking to Rouhanis foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif because he had no real influence on foreign policy and really no influence on regional policy the official said So we also wanted to speak to someone close to the supreme leader Tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran soared after Riyadh backed former US president Donald Trumps decision in to unilaterally withdraw the US from the nuclear deal with Tehran and impose crippling sanctions on the republic The following year Iran was blamed for orchestrating a sophisticated missile and drone attack on Saudi Arabias oil infrastructure that temporarily knocked out half the kingdoms crude output But Saudi Arabia appeared to have recalibrated its more assertive foreign policy after Biden took office pledging to reassess relations with the kingdom criticising the murder of Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents and freezing some arms sales to Riyadh Under crown prince Mohammed bin Salmans stewardship Riyadh aggressively pursued its war with Iranianbacked Houthi rebels in Yemen became embroiled in a bitter diplomatic dispute with Canada and briefly detained Saad Hariri while he was Lebanons prime minister But Prince Faisal insisted that Riyadh did not pick fights The leadership has a clear policy that the priority is prosperity building the country Vision reform plan and you cant deliver those things with a region in turmoil he said So while we will vigorously defend our national security and our sovereignty we will try to resolve them through diplomacy as well He added that there was a confluence of events that made it feel like it was the right moment to talk to Iran Diplomats say Riyadh wants Tehran to use its influence over the Houthi rebels in Yemen to help end the war there with the kingdom keen to exit the conflict after intervening in to back the ousted Yemeni government The Associated Press reported last month that satellite imagery showed that the US had pulled its Patriot air defence system out of Saudi Arabia But Prince Faisal said Washington had assured the kingdom that its commitment to our security and the security of our border is ironclad and we take them at their word We have a robust dialogue with the Americans we agree per cent of the time he said Are we unhappy about the general tone in Washington not the administration We think its not entirely based on where the true relationship is and the value of the relationship but its affected by domestic factors Copyright The Financial Times Limited 
213,../data/sec_IRL/Irish Times/Factiva-20230807-165,Opinion North’s politicians unite to keep abortion out Parties which claim to uphold human rights have abandoned women in Northern Ireland Susan McKay Wörter Oktober      It was quite the manel on display last week when the leaders of the Norths main Christian churches and their Council of Churches gathered in the Church of Irelands cathedral in Armagh to mark the centenary of partition Most quoted in the extensive news coverage was the head of the Catholic Church in Ireland Archbishop Eamon Martin who said he had to face the difficult truth that perhaps we in the churches could have done more to bring healing and peace to our divided and wounded communities The last time I recall these men joining forces to opine was in when they wrote to political leaders at Stormont urging them to recall the then suspended executive and stop the decriminalisation of abortion via legislation voted in at Westminster By coincidence the church service took place on the second anniversary of the Norths getting a British prochoice law which is one of the most humane in Europe But feminists marked the occasion with a protest in Belfast because the law is not being implemented One placard read Girls just want to have fundamental human rights The Norths Minister for Health Robert Swan of the UUP has not commissioned the abortion services required under the law and throughout the pandemic women still had to travel for abortions or go through with crisis pregnancies or take unregulated pills Earlier this month Belfasts high court ruled in a case brought by the NI Human Rights Commission that the British secretary of state had failed to comply with his duty to ensure that abortion services were provided expeditiously Foetal abnormality While the church service was taking place in Armagh Stormonts health committee voted in favour of a DUP Bill which would effectively deny women their legal rights in some of the worst situations imaginable The Bill seeks to amend the law to remove the right to abortion in cases of severe foetal abnormality The law currently allows for abortion after weeks gestation in such cases as well as if there is a fatal foetal abnormality In reality tests may only indicate the presence of such abnormalities at about weeks and medical diagnosis of the difference between severe and fatal is not always possible The amendment would force some women to rush an inevitably fraught decision in order to have a termination in the North Others would have to travel to England Some unable to do either would be forced to carry their pregnancy to full term or to the point when the foetus dies in their womb The Bills author is the current First Minister Paul Givan who believes that life begins at conception The DUP has fought to maintain that particular border in the Irish Sea The two DUP committee members voted for the Bill The UUPs one committee member also supported it dashing any hopes that the partys new leader Doug Beattie would stand up for womens reproductive rights The only two members who voted against the Bill were from People Before Profit and Alliance The SDLPs one member and Sinn Féins three members all abstained The Bill will potentially come before the full assembly for a vote within a few months At its first stage earlier this year just out of MLAs voted against it There has since been a consultation The NI Human Rights Commission medical experts and others have advised that it contravenes international human rights laws and standards The secretary of state can overrule the Assembly on this But northern feminists are furious that parties which claim to uphold human rights have abandoned them at this point in what has been a long hard struggle Women like Sarah Ewart Ashleigh Topley and Denise Phelan laid their agony before the public and in the courts Ewart described how her very personal family tragedy had been turned into a living nightmare Green Party leader Claire Bailey last week pressed forward her Bill to stop antichoice protesters harassing women outside clinics Topley spoke about her pain on seeing protesters carrying tiny white coffins like the ones in which she and other women had to bury their babies Extreme circumstances A opinion poll showed per cent of people in the North supported abortion in the kind of extreme circumstances such as a fatal foetal abnormality covered by Givans amendment Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said in the past she would fail as a legislator if she did not have an answer for all of those hard cases She has failed then The SDLP too It wants to shed its old conservative Catholic image yet party leader Colum Eastwood recently carried out a reshuffle that put an antiabortion MLA on the health committee The party allows its MLAs to vote according to their conscience thus making it impossible for the women actually faced with these decisions to act according to theirs The church men are not concerned with healing the wounds caused by the denial of bodily autonomy to women The politicians with honourable exceptions dont trust women Bernadette McAliskey made a thrilling statement at a rally for choice in Belfast in It should not sound controversial and blasphemous but it is a difficult truth that for women in the North it does This is my body she said

his studies in media and mass communication to build a career in journalism in the United Arab Emirates where he had lived from a young age Jaafar was years old when his father decided to move his family from their home in Baghdad to the UAE in the His father had worked as a fitness coach within the Saddam Hussein regime in Iraq and wanted a new start for his children We stayed in the UAE until and people were always very nice and kind But then they started to kick out a lot of people from the Shia Muslim religion people from Lebanon Syria and Iraq They didnt want to give us citizenship so they cancelled our visas Jaafar says he discovered his papers would not be renewed shortly after receiving his final university results When they told me I was losing my visa I was in shock I grew up in Dubai all my friends were there my whole life was there He decided to move back to Iraq a country he barely knew anymore My parents cried when I left the Emirates in this way When I reached Baghdad I was broken I was a stranger in Iraq after all that time People had changed behaviours had changed People laughed at my Emirates accent It was total shock I felt like I was going crazy Jaafar started rebuilding his life and found a job as a journalist with an Iraqi newspaper However he quickly grew disillusioned with the countrys political leadership and started posting articles on social media calling for changes in government He says he then received death threats for articulating these views Those people told me if you dont leave your job we will kill you Many people were reading my articles and my family said you need to leave Iraq immediately So I went to Turkey and waited around five months trying to cross the Aegean Sea to Greece Jaafars plan was to travel to Ireland where his parents had gone after their UAE visas were also cancelled His father had previously visited the country and felt it was a safe place for the family to start over with their two youngest children The older children some of whom already had families of their own moved to Turkey My sisters and brothers in Turkey they didnt know I was trying to cross the sea They were afraid for me I was too old for family reunification to join my parents but I wanted to get to Ireland They needed me I was the older child Jaafar eventually made it to Greece in where he spent a few months in a refugee camp before travelling across mainland Europe through Bulgaria Serbia Croatia and Slovenia Slovenia was the worst they put the dogs on us there Ill never forget those days They made us sleep outside on a farm and it was so cold I can still feel that cold in my hands Smuggler Jaafars odyssey continued through Austria Germany Denmark Sweden and finally Norway where he decided to apply for asylum He hoped that once he secured his papers he could travel to Ireland to see his family but the process took a long time and his application was rejected He says he eventually paid for a smuggler to get him back to Germany Jaafar understood that under the EUs Dublin regulation it was very unlikely he would secure refugee status in another European country following the Norwegian rejection However he hoped an exception would be made because his family were in Ireland My focus this whole time was just to get to my family But it was so hard I was scared and cold and some days I cried I travelled from Germany to Italy illegally over the border and was shocked by what I saw The refugees were living in the streets and for weeks I slept on the beach Jaafar ended up finding accommodation in Italy with the support of the Catholic Caritas charity and eventually secured humanitarian leave to remain in the country Getting permission to stay in Italy meant nothing I couldnt work and had no money I

219,../data/sec_IRL/Irish Times/Factiva-20230807-165,Opinion Interreligious dialogue is imperative By meeting as human beings we can begin to overcome our prejudices Sr Kathleen McGarvey Wörter November      In October we celebrated the month of mission throughout the world and were reminded of the call each baptised person and indeed every human being has been given to be an instrument of love peace and justice in our contemporary world This call is one to which many Irish missionaries have responded with love and generosity There are countless ways in which missionaries do this abroad and in their own country reaching out especially to those on the margins of society proclaiming and witnessing to the gospel through pastoral ministry social ministry healthcare education and through interreligious dialogue Mission in and through interreligious dialogue is today an imperative as never before not only because of the more pluralistic world we live in or because of the growing importance of religious identity in violent international national and ethnic conflicts but also so as to better understand our own Christian faith and mission today Pope Francis continuously emphasises the themes of fraternity social friendship and unity for which dialogue in all its forms among believers of various faiths and cultures is necessary In his message for World Mission Day he reminds us The history of evangelisation began with the Lords own passionate desire to call and enter into friendly dialogue with everyone just as they are Rebranded Last month at a media launch in the Veritas bookshop in Dublin World Mission Ireland was rebranded as Missio Ireland Missio is a global organisation which has its international headquarters in Rome and a national office in more than countries It is responsible for the Mission Sunday collection which is sent to the Popes universal solidarity fund These funds are then distributed to specific missionary projects throughout the world and Missio Ireland ensures that all contributions and donations received here are distributed justly and transparently Among the diverse projects and needs that are supported are interreligious dialogue and peacebuilding My own story can attest to that I was a missionary in Kaduna in northern Nigeria Nigeria is a great country with a booming population now nearly million about half Christian and half Muslim the north where I was based is majority Muslim Conflict too often erupts primarily due to poverty insecurity and bad governance and issues are framed along the lines of religious identity Today kidnapping is common as is extremist violence such as from Boko Haram as well as from socalled Fulani herdsmen causing clashes and rampages on villages This violence is extremely destructive with many lives lost and properties and livelihoods destroyed As in most cases throughout the world women suffer the brunt of poverty and are too often voiceless There are very strong womens faith organisations whether as womens wings in the Christian denominations or as national or denominationbased Muslim womens groups These organisations are very important to the women and they give them a voice within their faith communities Hence in I invited the women leaders of these faith organisations to come together to confront their concerns as women and to work in dialogue to help bring peace justice and security for all Grown and developed Thus we established the Interfaith Forum of Muslim and Christian Womens Association which is commonly known as the Womens Interfaith Council WIC This organisation has grown and developed primarily due to the work of committed and convinced Muslim and Christian women of faith Recently the WIC was awarded the Aachen Peace Prize WIC is funded by many people including by Missio Without these funds the organisation could not continue and certainly could not carry out its objectives This kind of work is urgent today not only in Nigeria but throughout the world including here in Ireland where Islamophobia racism and hate speech are experienced too often It is through meeting each other as human beings and not as Muslims and Christians that we can begin to overcome our prejudices about each other learn to appreciate each other in our needs and beliefs and learn to coexist and build a peaceful and just world During these past months of the global pandemic we have all become very aware that the actions of one of us affect the lives of all of us and indeed of all creation We have witnessed the selfless sacrifice of people who have been there for us frontline workers and so many others people of all faiths and of none who have found ways to reach out in a spirit of community and solidarity As a human family we are invited to work together to advance a culture of mutual respect in the awareness of our being brothers and sisters all responsible for each other and for our common home Sr Kathleen McGarvey OLA is the provincial leader in Ireland of the Missionary Sisters of Our Lady of Apostles 
220,../data/sec_IRL/Irish Times/Factiva-20230807-165,Features I have a feeling of peace that other Palestinians yearn for’ World Bank legal consultant arrived from Bethlehem during the pandemic Sorcha Pollak Wörter November      Amanie Issa was sitting in a lecture hall learning about human rights the first time she experienced a raid on her university You feel all this pepper in your face and everyone started running and screaming the tear gas was too much to bear The Israeli forces were arresting people and smashing computers it was traumatising The irony was we were in class learning about our human rights When they left everything was quiet you could see smoke and rubber bullets And then we just went back to class That happened multiple times a year The normalisation of it all is what sticks in my mind the running hiding and then going back to class Travelling from her home in Bethlehem to classes at the AlQuds University in Jerusalem each day was also a challenge I had to go through checkpoints that should take minutes but could take two hours You always needed to have your green ID it was so stressful My four years of undergrad were not normal we always had to be prepared for the unexpected Born in Bethlehem into a Muslim family Issas parents sent her to a private Catholic girls school where her mother felt her daughters could get the best education My mum stopped school when she was and she had to work to provide for the family She loved education and had dreams of becoming a doctor But she married really young and never had the chance for a proper education She made a promise to herself that if she had daughters she would make it her priority to get us an education She told me one day when I look at you its exactly what I envisioned getting your masters going after your education I owe her a lot Growing up Issas parents preferred not to speak at home about the political instability of the West Bank region where they lived She recalls seeing tanks pass on the streets and asking her mother why school closed unexpectedly and curfews were implemented I was a very curious child and asked lots of questions She explained that people came and took our land from us and that they kept taking our land She tried to simplify it without going into details Issa still clearly remembers watching a news report on TV about a child in the West Bank who had been shot in the head From then on I started having nightmares I thought they were going to kill me and my family and take our house and land Why arent our rights protected She found her school teachers also avoided speaking about the regions conflict Not many parents wanted their kids getting too much political information I still dont know the logic behind that its important to know where its all coming from In history we learned about the UN and its structure and about its protection of rights My question was were Palestinian and were humans why arent our rights protected After school Issa studied for a BA in international law and human rights at AlQuds Bard College in East Jerusalem and in she was awarded a scholarship to study in Ireland through the IrelandPalestine programme and secured a place on the Masters in International Human Rights Law at the Irish Centre for Human Rights in NUI Galway Having spent a brief period studying in the Czech Republic during her undergraduate degree Issa was keen to travel abroad again Id experienced some normal university life in the Czech Republic but this would be for a whole year I could get up at have my coffee and go to class without working out about checkpoints or my green ID I was so happy when I was accepted but then they sent out an email saying classes for the first semester would be online because of Covid Issa was given the option to defer her studies but chose to push ahead and arrived in Galway in September I got really depressed with the online classes although having curfews and not leaving home felt familiar It felt like I was back to square one I couldnt go outside because there were bad things happening outside This time it wasnt the occupation it was the pandemic But both are hurting people When they announced the second semester was also going to be online I broke down It was the hardest year of my life Fortunately Issa met other scholarships students like herself and became close with a Nigerian girl living in her apartment complex When I look back now I realised everything happens for a reason and I learned a lot Ive learned to value everything lockdown has taught me about this In May Issa was asked to speak at a protest in Galway held in response to the Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip I didnt know what to say so I just said what I felt And I felt proud of myself Its true that being involved in politics is exhausting but its worth it if youre doing it for a purpose and fighting for your existence This year has made me even prouder to be Palestinian Issa also felt heartened by the Irish solidarity with the Palestinian cause My dad used to talk about the Irish struggle when we were younger we knew land was taken from them by the British I feel Irish people understand the concept of land better than others They speak with pride about Ireland the same way I speak about Palestine That solidarity had made me fall in love with Ireland even more Ireland is my home away from home now Feeling a sense of guilt Issa travelled to Bethlehem to visit family for a few weeks in September but is now back in Galway working remotely for the World Bank as a legal consultant focusing on womens economic and social development She hopes to stay and do a PhD but admits feeling a sense of guilt about the peace and comfort she enjoys living in Ireland when so many people continue to struggle in her home country The other day I was sitting by the river reading Sally Rooneys new book and it was so peaceful So many Palestinians never experience that their dream is to sit by the water and read a book Ive had that feeling of peace that others are yearning for while their school is demolished or theyre kicked out of their house Every person in the world

comedy scene conveys serious messages about the country’s fragile democracy Sally Hayden Wörter Dezember      When he was still in control of the Gambia Africas smallest mainland country Yahya Jammeh presided over a macabre kind of graduation The eccentric dictator who claimed he had discovered the cure for Aids would bring infected people for treatment at his state house smearing green paste on them forcing them to drink herbal mixtures and banning them from taking their usual antiretroviral drugs before releasing them in televised ceremonies as he declared them cured Sometimes there was a foursome of young performers in attendance Their job was to praise a man who they knew could have them and everyone they knew disappeared or killed He gave us money says Assan Jobe now We were very young We were not thinking about criticising him at that point Jammeh was ousted in after years in power He has not faced justice and lives in exile in Equatorial Guinea Many of the Gambias banknotes still bear his face This sliver of land in West Africa is known as the smiling coast because of its shape and positioning on maps You can get an idea how small the Gambia is from the telephone numbers which are just seven digits long It has a population of roughly million people almost threequarters of whom are under the age of Over the past five years they have adjusted to their newfound democracy and freedom of speech with the involvement of one key group of influencers comedians Bright Stars Entertainment is made up of four members now in their mid to late The young men who met while they were volunteering with the Red Cross say they no longer want to reflect on the past or what it was like growing up in a dictatorship Speaking days before the Gambias December election the first since Jammeh left power they say their focus is on whoever will be the new president and they would be front and centre protesting before the country turned towards authoritarianism again Assan says comedy is a useful tool in a dictatorship because you can address issues without insulting the leadership But when Jammeh was in power they had to censor the content very well Nogo zones included the government itself the work of the government Ridiculing them Some of the things they were not doing Now he says we believe we have the right to say anything while making sure their jokes are based on facts and respect We dont want to talk about Jammeh now he has no influence over the country we dont even think about him It was like we were sleeping Never again says Pa Modou Yaffa Do you believe in oxygen Its so sweet We enjoy breathing the oxygen of democracy Police brutality One of the issues they have spoken out about is police brutality We have so much police brutality We came out and said the police should be respectful to everyone and we all deserve democracy and justice says Assan They create songs using them to talk about corruption In one of the songs we said follow the money We want to know where the donations are going he says In another they make fun of the sporadic electricity supply citizens were dealing with which served less than half of the population It went viral says Yaffa Shortly afterwards a government deal with Turkish company Karpower was announced Still they feel they walk a difficult line between challenging power and encouraging stability We are not enemies We work with the government just sometimes we pinpoint issues that are affecting the society We are neutral we are not into any politician All we want is national development says Assan Bright Stars Entertainment have more than followers on Facebook on Instagram and more than subscribers on YouTube On TikTok they have racked up more than half a million views We meet in Assans family home Music videos play on a large TV in the sittingroom Outside his family sit together sharing a large bowl of food The comedians complain that local TV stations regularly run their videos on air but dont pay them There are no royalties says Assan You will post it and in seconds or one minute you will see it circulated says Yaffa Instead they make an income producing content for UN agencies as well as earning performance fees for galas or weddings writing theme songs for commercials and getting a small bit of money from YouTube As we speak another member Buba A Jallow stage name Pa Furmose gets a call asking them to perform at a banks staff party in January he agrees to it When they come together they create sketches quickly says Assan Its four good heads not four empty heads The only time they ever left the country was on a Red Crossrelated trip to neighbouring Senegal We have content but we are left behind when it comes to the opportunities says Yaffa The plan for the future is to perform all over the world bring the culture of Africa to America to Europe to Asia to build a legacy Around per cent of Gambians now have access to the internet up from per cent in according to the World Bank This presents a big opportunity Over the past few years Assan says the advent of TikTok in particular has encouraged a lot more young Gambians to become involved in comedy Social media is everything says Assan Facebook Twitter YouTube Instagram TikTok its where you sell yourself Advertisements and contracts For Tida Jobe that is certainly true Two years ago the was a housewife Scrolling on her phone at home she discovered TikTok first laughing at Senegalese comedians and white people content from America Now she says she is Gambias mostfollowed comedian with nearly fans and million likes On Instagram she has followers She makes her living from advertisements and contracts which take time to negotiate but the videos come naturally she says I will place my camera think of something crazy and do it Sometimes she posts up to six videos a day In one of her videos Tida imagines that she is set to be the third wife of a reluctant Adama Barrow the incumbent president whose shock election win in was the reason Jammeh was forced to leave the country She has also made videos about Gambian diaspora attempts to cook local food marabouts Muslim holy men and an imagined conversation between Jammeh and presidential candidate Ousainou Darboe whom supporters call Gambias Mandela because he was imprisoned during the dictatorship Tida also emphasises that she is neutral I just keep it respectful I always say when Jammeh was around he would really appreciate me Like many of the Gambias other comedians Tida recorded a video before the election calling on her followers to choose peace at all times She says it was partially inspired by a meeting with a UNbacked organisation called Peace Hub in the leadup to the vote in which six Gambian influencers were encouraged to create this kind of content Tida will not say who she voted for but after the results were announced she went to a huge victory rally held for the incumbent Barrow who won another term with per cent of the vote compared to Darboes per cent I published videos from the celebration told the people now we have a new president lets come together she says The president is the president we cannot go against the president After Jammeh was ousted a government monopoly on broadcast news was broken and the Gambias media industry flourished Dozens of private radio stations were set up as well as at least five private TV stations One of the most popular new channels is QTV which runs a weekly sketch comedy show by Muhammed Nyang a Gambian comedian popularly known as Wagan At he is older than the others and has been working for longer The first time I am supposed to interview him is the day after the election result Several opposition candidates including Darboe have refused to concede alleging that the voting had been rigged I am getting out of a taxi when I unexpectedly get teargassed First opposition supporters come running by Then I spot police lined up to my left facing off with them Two begin to shoot tear gas and the protesters retreat Demonstrations My eyes run and I douse a surgical mask in drinking water putting that across my mouth Two women collapse on the ground ahead of me with others pouring water on their faces Some of the protesters throw stones and bottles This is one of a smattering of demonstrations over a few days When I first visited the Gambia in early Jammeh had been gone for a year At that time many Gambians were vocal about how excited they were that they could finally express their feelings In particular they wanted to explain how Jammeh had made them suffer Nearly four years later the country remains one of the poorest in the world ranking in the bottom countries globally in last years UN Human Development Report The pandemic has further damaged an economy where tourism made up as much as per cent of the GDP and supported more than jobs directly or indirectly according UN figures Many Gambians are worried about the future blaming their countrys woes on the current administration They are also concerned about the intentions of Barrow who had promised to step down after three years of a transitional period but reneged on this pledge and will now serve at least another five The price of cooking oil has doubled in a year worries one taxi driver Freedom of speech we have it but apart from that its not easy Wagan and I reschedule the interview for the following afternoon by which stage the protests have mostly stopped He is polite wearing a Tshirt and suit trousers and sitting hunched in an office chair He explains his backstory he ran a shop selling clothes in one of the Gambias biggest markets before he got involved in comedy in when he was First Wagan had a radio programme focused on skits but nothing political Comedy back then wasnt popular then we had very few people who were into it he says The current generation is luckier than we are There are so many TV stations now so many radio stations Today he says the point of his show is to hold powerful people to account Im very impartial in my work it doesnt matter who it is the president opposition leaders or anybody My programme has a huge following there is no censorship Even the politicians who were not very welcoming at the beginning now they all love it Even the president loves it Yet he too is still cautious when it comes to the fragility of the Gambias new democracy He says he would be hesitant to mention the main opposition party in his upcoming show amid a wait to see whether they will challenge the election results legally once it becomes a court matter I cant comment on it In the meantime Wagan feels a responsibility to encourage citizens to trust in the process because everybody knows Wagan He sees the power of comedians in the Gambia as on a par with journalists and musicians I think we all have an important role to play and I think it should be a collective approach he says When I ask why comedians are so influential in this small country QTVs head of programming Lassana Tunkara chimes in Comedy here is often used to convey serious messages he says For example charities and nongovernmental organisations will hire comedians to help spread the word about different initiatives That phenomenon does not exist in England etc Tunkara who comes from London adds that hes been trying to get Wagan to watch Laurel and Hardy and Charlie Chaplin all the masters Wagan says he has never travelled outside the Gambia but would like to perform abroad At the recording of the Wagan Show on Wednesday Wagan his partner Haddy Nyang and a troupe of others swap in and out playing different characters on their small set performing in front of a screen with Wagans face on it Wagan uses a brush to apply talcum powder to his eyebrows and becomes the chairman of the Independent Electoral Commission IEC poking fun at the mans sluggishness in announcing the election results he becomes Adama Barrow the incumbent president celebrating another term flanked by his two wives then he applies makeup to become the mayor of Banjul an opposition supporter who had called on the president to concede There is dancing drumming and at least once the filming has to be restarted because the cast are laughing too much At the beginning of the show though Wagan reiterates his calls for peace

reregister their Sim cards with their fingerprints and facial image which is not required in other parts of the Buddhistmajority country The order took effect last year just as lockdowns were imposed to contain the coronavirus pandemic The countrys three mobile service providers sent text messages to customers then cut off services to thousands who had failed to register by the deadline While the order applied to all residents it affected Malay Muslims disproportionately Many of them were elderly or lived in villages meaning they could not travel to cities in time to register their data according to human rights groups that have questioned the need for biometrics in the southern provinces alone Others chose to reject the order wary of increasing government surveillance in the Malayspeaking southern region The government thinks everyone here is involved in insurgency and antinational activities and puts security above our privacy and rights said Anchana Heemmina founder of Duay Jai Group a human rights organisation We have no idea who has access to our data or how it is used Insisting on biometrics for mobile phone users only in the deep south is discrimination and amounts to ethnic profiling of Malay Muslims she said Prevent violence Thai authorities have said the measures are needed to help prevent violence in the region and that biometrics will help stamp out identity theft and the use of unregistered Sim cards in mobile phones to detonate explosive devices Maintaining public safety and protecting civil rights is a question of balance said Ronnasil Poosara commander of the southern border provinces police operation centre Attacks triggered by mobile phones have fallen since the order he said adding that tracking suspects had become more effective with the use of biometrics Worldwide counterterrorism has increasingly been cited as justification for new security laws here and government monitoring from mass data collection to the growing use of artificial intelligence AI tools to target certain groups Last month Apple warned at least six activists and researchers critical of the Thai government that it believed their iPhones had been targeted by statesponsored attackers In Thailands southern border provinces security forces began collecting DNA samples of Malay Muslims in for a data bank that officials said would help in their investigations of insurgent attacks In recent years security forces have been collecting DNA samples at checkpoints and during raids of homes and schools often without consent said Pornpen Khongkachonkiet director of the Cross Cultural Foundation The human rights group documented about such coerced cases from January to September alone Authorities have denied that samples were collected without consent The southern border provinces were also the first to see the installation of more than AIenabled cameras connected to a central surveillance system that authorities said would ensure the local populations safety But there are few details about who provides the technology how it is used or what protections people have said Pornpen Thailands Computer Crime Act of and the Cybersecurity Law of give the government authority to conduct surveillance and to search and seize data and equipment in cases deemed to threaten national security In the south special counterinsurgency laws give authorities even greater powers with the lack of adequate data protection failing residents rights campaigners say The use of facialrecognition technology violates peoples privacy and freedom There is so much surveillance people feel they are in detention all the time Its constant harassment said Pornpen A spokesperson for internal security operations command a unit of the Thai military said biometrics and facial recognition technology were an essential part of its monitoring and risk notification system to identify separatist insurgents From Colombia to China governments rolled out new technologies and additional surveillance measures during the pandemic that human rights groups say are directed at minority groups and will outlast the health crisis The suspension of mobile services in Thailands south follows alleged abuses documented by Human Rights Watch including extrajudicial killings enforced disappearances and torture of suspected insurgents Thai authorities have denied these reports Sim cards No official data has been released on how many mobile numbers were suspended after the new order came into effect but Pornpen estimated that about a third of the nearly a million registered Sim cards have been disconnected or risk being cut The CrossCultural Foundation has filed a lawsuit on behalf of a resident in Pattani against the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission a government agency which issued the order to mobile service providers The case is pending Those whose services were cut they are cut off from their families their businesses are affected their children cannot do remote study and they could not access crucial information on Covid which made them more vulnerable said Pornpen Its a grave human rights violation Thomson Reuters Foundation

Simpson Wörter Januar      A few months ago Jan Carson shared on Twitter a photo of a framed cheque made out for the grand sum of I was living in the States at the time and I took it to the bank to get cashed and it was going to cost to cash it she laughs And so the cheque remained un cashed and now serves as a memento it was payment for her first published short story in Writings a long game folks she added to the tweet Dont be rushing And here we are years later as Carson is about to publish her seventh book and third novel The Raptures We meet in Jacks coffee shop in east Belfast where most of the book was written At that table over there she says pointing My table The wobbly one with the serviette stuck under the leg She doesnt I take it require silence and solitude to write Im like that for nonfiction essays and articles she agrees But for fiction its a bit like how painters need to look at the thing theyre painting I need to look up and see people moving how their faces go when theyre concentrating The process seems to have worked for The Raptures which is full of realistic characters that the reader comes to love and hate Before I began I wrote short stories for each of the characters in the novel So Id already done all the character development for them The novel praised ahead of publication by Marian Keyes is set in the fictional rural Northern Irish town of Ballylack in the early and has an intriguing concept The children of the town a religious Protestant community begin dying of an unexplained condition which drives parents to distraction with anxiety attracts media attention and isolates the one girl who appears unaffected That girl Hannah Adger is the moral centre of the story along with her grandfather Pete In a book full of surprises its hard to reveal much about what happens but the novel takes in family crises religious and social paralysis smuggling wracking guilt and conversations with dead children It sounds grim but surprisingly or not for those who are familiar with Carsons work its funny particularly when the dead children take the stage I cant really write any other way says Carson I can try to write deadly serious stuff but it doesnt come out of me right it sounds forced Theres always a bent towards humour and a bent towards the fantastical as well but it has to be grounded in something quite solid I cant see myself writing a slapstick novel or a fantasy novel That brings us to another feature in Carsons novels how she blends real life and fantastical elements Her acclaimed novel The Fire Starters set in modern Northern Ireland features mythical children a Siren and having softened the reader up to the strange lurking inside the everyday traditional Belfast bonfires straddling a line between the quotidian and the weird Similarly The Raptures is driven by tension between the mystery of what might be causing the children to die a curse dark magic or something more mundane and what is really happening Any resemblance to a real pandemic is by the way coincidental The book was written almost three years ago Northern Ireland is as Carson comments a paradox a place steeped in religion where folks can be quite comfortable with the miraculous but not comfortable at all with magic or folklore particularly in the Protestant community For example the church I grew up in was cessationist so they believe the age of miracles ended with the New Testament But I came across all of these elders who were practising curers they were rubbing potatoes on things and burying them in the garden As strict Presbyterians they would reject religious miracles but use cures So theres this really strange interplay in the North between those things and I want The Raptures to be deliberately ambiguous what on earth is going on here Indeed The Raptures is close to Carsons own upbringing near Ballymena In the acknowledgements she describes it as the book Ive been trying to write for years What did she mean Its really close to home This is right on my doorstep where I grew up I think writing about the world of your childhood and the community that you belong to is probably the hardest thing to do Its a balanced portrait with the good the bad and lots of grey in between One of the most striking characters is Alan Gardiner who appears deeply unsympathetic for example he admits to himself that he doesnt love his own mixedrace son I didnt want him to be a flat stock character explains Carson Hes an example of that thing in Northern Ireland of these people who are desperately desperately screwed up But theyve come from a long line of people who didnt expose them to anything openminded or challenging Theres an expectation she says that the next generation will make everything right But theyve never seen anything outside of here Theyre just going to do the same thing over This is one reason why the book is set in the early I set it in because if something happens after the internet theres slightly less excuse for kids to be blinkered because they have this portal into other communities But in Ballymena in unless you had parents who were taking you somewhere else you werent seeing anything except what was happening in the three miles around you Another political facet of the book Carson hopes people will engage with is that to me its a feminist text Its about how women are treated within these conservative religious environments And this happens to be evangelical Protestantism but its just as pertinent to Muslim communities Catholic communities Hasidic Jewish communities In The Raptures Hannah and her mother struggle against the status quo I spent a lot of time thinking about how you write those characters that are aspirational for women but are also believable Theres a lot of books about women who go against the system but the majority of women are stuck within the system Theyre in a small quiet way trying to change it from the inside So I hope some of that comes out Carson is now part of a growing community of women fiction writers in and from east Belfast including Lucy Caldwell and Wendy Erskine The cafe were sitting in is next to CS Lewis Square which is scattered with statues of Narnia characters though Carson admits quietly I dont really like CS Lewiss work that much But I think hes one of the most marketable things we have in Northern Ireland because hes internationally known Yet as Carson has pointed out on her Twitter account modern writers from the North seem to struggle to be recognised in some Irish outlets a recent essay in the Dublin Review of Books on books by young Irish women had no mention of northern writers Its like how can you not notice whats going on up here asks Carson In the next year theres The Raptures theres Lucy Caldwell Wendy Erskine Bernie McGill And then theres Michelle Gallen Louise Kennedy Olivia Fitzsimons Hopefully if we keep pointing it out it will change because its their loss The Raptures is the third book Carson has published since the start of the pandemic following her collection of flash fiction Postcard Stories and her short stories The Last Resort Shes also active in the local community as an arts facilitator Might it seem unjust to ask whats next Im knackered she says I need a circuit breaker Forty years ago you could be a writer and just write books Now theres this expectation of the persona of the writer Thats exhausting I had a piece on Radio on Monday I had two strangers coming up to me in the street one of them cried But Carson says she has among other things another novel written a project on how dementia is depicted in fiction and shes editing an anthology of short stories coming from New Island this year So yes she can have a break But not we hope for too long Jan Carsons The The Raptures is published by Doubleday and is reviewed on page

into Nigeria’s biggest city Sally Hayden Wörter Januar      Tom Saater has travelled across Nigeria and much of the world photographing a mixture of touristic sites cultural happenings wars and crises His work has been published by major outlets including the New York Times Time magazine the Financial Times and the Washington Post But during a regular week in Lagos hes as likely to be working as a driver ferrying passengers to the airport or bringing them around the city for meetings In Lagos a city of more than million people commuters spend an average of hours a week sitting in traffic The roads are badly planned out and regularly congested A trip can take nearly four hours and the roads come to a standstill during heavy rain Still driving is very therapeutic for me Saater says Its a counter to photojournalism which can be extreme or overwhelming and offers a buffer from the stress of being freelance which means one moment he might have money and the next its gone The has seen Lagos from many angles photographing everyone from the chief executives of massive corporations to the socalled Area Boys gang members producing work somewhat reminiscent of renowned photographer Don McCullins portraits of the gangs of north London Extremes You cannot describe Lagos you can only experience it he says sitting in the apartment he shares with friends in an upscale part of the city The city is very fascinating its vibrant Theres so much happening so many layers Everything here is extreme Theres extreme wealth extreme poverty He calls Lagos a melting pot very overpopulated with massive inequality but a lot of opportunities a place where people become millionaires overnight Saater himself has what he calls a rags to riches story After being abandoned by his mother he lived with a grandmother when she died he spent his teenage years homeless He says he used to sleep on newspapers and thats how he became interested in photography At the time he was based in Abuja Nigerias capital and he often encountered tourists or foreign visitors carrying cameras He started carrying a sketchpad and drawing the cameras from a distance before approaching the owner proffering his sketch and asking could they teach him to use it While the majority refused some would explain how it worked even letting him take a photo and sending it to him later through a local post office As he got older he found some temporary work in a photo studio then got a tipoff that Time Out magazine was opening in Nigeria After he emailed the editor saying he could show the magazines photographers around his city she asked him to send his own photos and eventually commissioned him herself One of the many people Saater met when inquiring about cameras an American man offered to buy him one so he could accept the job Saater says A Canon arrived in the post I couldnt believe it I was just crying When I opened it and I saw it I almost fainted From there he earned enough money to rent a house in a shanty town It was in a slum but for me that was heaven For me I had made it in life Area Boys Saaters background has made it easier for him to find a rapport and empathise with the people he photographs he says He first came across the Area Boys when they tried to steal his equipment Im a very very curious person and I wanted to understand why they do this thing He found out that the security guard where he was living used to be involved and managed to get an introduction And so I spent some time with them just hanging out with them having a drink with them People like to talk So we hang out talking about football soccer politics and music They come from really poor homes he said Lagos has a huge unemployment issue If one of their parents was an Area Boy or gang member of course they get influenced by that This is how they were able to feed the family and survive He said the Area Boys ranged from teenagers to men in their but the majority were in their As they get older they find other ways to survive like working as bus drivers security guards ticket inspectors in construction or by selling secondhand clothes or street food Saater said there is a clear difference between Nigeria and rich countries in the West in that there is no social welfare and no safety net For everybody here theres no bailout And it makes me understand why sometimes people dont want to help others If something happens to me nobodys going to help me He said that chasm became even clearer during the pandemic To quarantine is a privilege Its a huge privilege to be able to stay in your house and not do anything Nigeria is a beautiful country he emphasises But its a very difficult country to live in as well And if youre someone that has a lot of conscience about other peoples sufferings that can affect you it can take a toll on you Youre basically working and living to support other people all the time And you can easily neglect yourself abandon yourself in service for other people People are genuinely suffering here Recession Nigerias economy went into recession in and again in after the pandemic began when the World Bank warned it was facing the worst decline in four decades Roughly onethird of Nigerians are officially unemployed Some per cent of the countrys population are under the age of meaning the numbers of people looking for work can only continue to grow Yet people are entrepreneurs here Saater says Theres a strong entrepreneurial spirit These are very hardworking people They hustle and do whatever it takes to make money In Saaters home there is a copy of his last New York Times front page story from September It shows recently surrendered members of the Boko Haram insurgent group sitting with their backs turned in front of pieces of coloured cloth Saater started reporting in Nigerias wartorn northeast in In Lagos roughly away he said people are aware of what is happening but they dont care It doesnt affect them Its almost a different country There is also a misconception in Lagos that its a religious war he continues I think more Muslims are being killed than Christians And yes Boko Haram are Muslim Their religion is Islamic but they also dont represent what Islam is about Even in that situation Saater had empathy He said one defector described how he had been recruited young and effectively been brainwashed Saater was both full of rage for the horrible acts the group has carried out as well as understanding that the man had been misled He talks about how his childhood was taken away from him his teenage years taken away from him he will never be able to be himself again And I feel really bad for him Saater has travelled the world because of his photography to countries including Germany Canada the Netherlands Italy the UK Bosnia and Herzegovina Turkey and across a lot of Africa He has also been working on a longterm series called Finding a Family a personal project exploring what it feels like to be part of a family in a home For it he photographs himself in other peoples homes watching TV with children or sitting at a dinner table with two parents As time goes on I realise I will never be like other people And I cant talk about my work without talking about my past Saater said For now when hes not abroad Saater continues to drive around and document the vast city he lives in Every day I reflect back from where Im coming from I feel like its a dream Sometimes I feel like Ill just disappear Like all this will be taken away from me

Communist Party there would be no new China The jingoistic line the title of a famous revolutionary song was received warmly Well said well said Xi responded last week from behind a surgical mask embossed with the red flag of the Peoples Republic of China Thank you for your support The exchange later broadcast by Chinese state media was one of a series of meetings held between Chinas leaders and more than autocrats democratic leaders and royals on the sidelines of the Winter Olympics They came to Beijing despite US calls for a diplomatic boycott in protest at Xis crackdowns on Xinjiang and Hong Kong and highlighted Chinas new standing in the international order according to former government officials and China foreign policy experts The vision of foreign heads of state speed dating with Xi Jinping in Beijing is something to behold said Nadège Rolland a former senior adviser to the French defence ministry who compared it with the ancient Chinese tributary system The visitors

support for Moscow as the West opposes Russias military buildup on the Ukraine border deepening Beijings divide with Washington The Olympics according to Dawn Murphy a foreign policy expert at the US Air War College and author of Chinas Rise in the Global South has illustrated that China has a lot of friends in the international system after years of building stronger economic and political bonds

Asian Research a US think tank noted that in exchange for trade and investment the leaders paid homage and offered deference to Xi and have endorsed the Chinese governance model Such exchanges are part of an older worldview that is actually deeply ingrained in the way that Chinese elites are thinking about their own role on the global stage right now she said Xis meetings with the leaders of Muslimmajority countries such as Khan spotlighted their silence over Chinas actions in Xinjiang the northwestern region where more than one million Uighurs have been interned Human rights issues Part of them not wanting to criticise China is because they dont want to bring themselves criticism of their own internal human rights issues Murphy said adding Many Arab countries do not necessarily see the Uighurs as being ethnically the same as them because they come from Turkic origins The number of leaders and dignitaries in Beijing was still well below the more than present inside the Birds Nest

personally sometimes gets me down I want to know other lives very badly The most I can hope to do is try and mix it up a bit perhaps train myself to appreciate rutabaga or learn Icelandic but I will still fundamentally be stuck being myself The lives of others and her own occupy the Cork writer and actors new collection of essays Tell Everyone on This Train I Love Them Positioned on a trajectory her previous collections Off You Go We Have a Good Time Dont We and Maeve in America Essays by a Girl from Somewhere Else tell a sequential story of a writer evolving and going deeper Higgins who is from Cobh and lives in New York is enjoying a multifaceted creative career seemingly gravitating towards wherever the juicy stuff is She recently completed a masters in international migration studies and throughout this collection there is a sense of a writer who desires to learn about herself and others There are essays on a border security expo the climate crisis and the reality TV show Day Fiancés lessons about immigration and US citizenship The title is taken from the final words of Taliesin Myrddin NamkaiMeche a who was killed when he tried to stop a racist attack against two Muslim girls on a train in Portland Humour orbits Higgins who began her career as a comedian on television sketch shows and as a standup But her nonfiction writing essays columns journalism is underpinned by a serious call to step outside the self and take in what other people are going through So the essays are another sort of orbit a transmission about her experience through the lives of others that spins out and catches the context of others As a columnist for the New York Times and a columnist with the US Guardian what was often framed as Higginss whimsy or even surrealism has been honed in recent years evolving into a deeper bank of writing that often focuses on immigration and a sense of awayness of trying to understand the context that surrounds you when you move and when everyone else is moving too That theme of immigration and migration is a frequent one for Higgins but in assessing her own experience its one that she expands outwards gravitating towards the stories of others where people are trying to make something of themselves do their best yet often face the kinds of obstacles that limit freedoms and reduce lives to where they travel to not who they are Growing up in Cobh we learned a lot about the people that left the migrants from the worst times in colonised Irelands history and that always fascinated me she says Leaving one life behind overcoming obstacles starting anew there is such a strong narrative in every migrants story Those factors as well as moving to the US myself sparked my initial interest in migration as a framework around which to better understand what was happening around me and where I fit in The deeper I looked and the more I learned I began to understand that migration is a lens to look through at all of the biggest challenges we face today global warming growing inequality When you combine any or all of these crises with birthplace citizenship and the freedom to move it becomes this tangle of hundreds of threads to follow Increasingly Higgins has focused on the systems in place that create conditions migrants have to navigate Take a border she says Often it is an invisible line decided by someone a long time ago who may never even have been to that place in their life And we are all just supposed to agree that yes this is the border there lies a different state and here we are and yes there is a famine here but we must die here quietly now because we all agree we are not allowed to step over the magic invisible line decided on by a stranger many years ago It is and I say this after careful consideration absolutely crazy There are diversions in the new book too such as an episode induced by eating a box of artisanal candy that turned out to be cannabis edibles that she turns into an allegory about the precariousness of mental health among other things Often the essays begin as something gentle easing the reader in before starwiping to display layers of meaning Higginss work tender funny serious is always about human stories rather than just stories with humans in them Sometimes those human stories are hers sometimes its a bunch of border police sometimes its historical figures moulded into statues One essay stands out Misneach and Rumors of War unearths the connections between the statue of a teenage girl on horseback by John Byrne that stands outside Trinity Comprehensive School in Dublins Ballymun and another in Richmond Virginia called Rumors of War where another teenager sits on a horse and the anticolonialist and antiracist connections that swirl around them both Life goes around in circles it does Higgins writes but sometimes those circles spin so hard they transfer something new to the next round I want to hold Americas face when it lights up with a fever Im afraid will set her whole self aflame and tell her that theres not an easy answer except to fight and to win and to get free in all the ways that a person can be free In recent years acting in other peoples work has seen Higgins star in the film Extra Ordinary and the Kevin Barry play Autumn Royal Her stage presence and her charisma on screen has a magnetism that doesnt just pull audiences in but also pulls other artists towards her Extra Ordinary Mike Ahern and Enda Loughmans comedy horror was developed with Higgins chosen for the lead from the start Barry wrote Autumn Royal with Higgins in mind While Siobhán McSweeney played the role of May on its Irish run back in Shes brilliant Higgins says the play came back around to Higgins in one of those magic windows where live art could happen in when it ran at the Irish Repertory Theatre in Manhattan I still cant believe it happened and that we did it she says of the fiveweek rehearsal and the ensuing sixweek run Higgins used to resist theatre and its air of importance in part because standup is so casual and embraces opportunities to be off the cuff This was a deeper harder thing Higgins says of the play I was talking to Kevin about acting You know Im not a trained actor and I really wanted to get it right She asked him for ideas and advice which he gave in a real laidback way One of the things he mentioned was something Stephen Rea said once that someone pulls a lever and his brain switches into a character and into a world That was really useful for me because Im May the character trapped in a house with my brother At the beginning of the play there was a sound effect that happens and she used that as a trigger to go It was a huge learning thing for me It was one of the best work experiences I ever had You know how it is with writing you write something and it has this strange afterlife People give you feedback a year and a half after youve written it Social media is a thing Comedy used to be that way but now its all takes and commodified But with this it happened and the pandemic stopped happening In Extra Ordinary Higgins sold the gags and the slapstick well even as the films intentionally bonkers aspects ran away a little as it reached its climax But what was interesting was how Higgins held the quiet aspects of her performance so beautifully She had a depth that felt that this character had more to say to do to feel Others thought so too Extra Ordinary is now being adapted by Maya Rudolph and Natasha Lyonne for a series by American network TBS In the context of the pandemic many are reevaluating their interactions with the world in terms of the things that matter and the things that can be shed such as social media about which Higgins offers For creative people its so destructive Its a distraction I sound like Im writing a think piece in or something In Michaela Coels speech from the Emmys which resonated with many writers she said In a world that entices us to browse through the lives of others to help us better determine how we feel about ourselves and to in turn feel the need to be constantly visible for visibility these days seems to somehow equate to success do not be afraid to disappear From it From us For a while And see what comes to you in the silence Higgins says Simone Biles was really the one for me referring to the American gymnast withdrawing from certain competitions at the Olympics Athletes have to be so public too to sell their personality She was the one for me where I was like that is so brave and so cool I literally felt something shift in me it doesnt fking matter For her she would have been in danger if she kept going I think for a lot of us women who are out there grinding I dont know how best to put it but youre not always proving yourself and you have to pay for it somehow Its a selfpreservation thing too to step back and again not so you can just do something incredible but literally just step back and see what happens This is me speaking aspirationally I still have loads of ambitions Act fast she says of holding on during the early stages of creative work sketch out the idea thats flashed into your mind or tell a collaborator about it or just speak it all into your phone In my I had tons of ideas but could always think my way out of them by listing all of the ways they could fail Then I figured out that plenty of people will do that for you plenty of people will explain why you cant do something so you really need to just try Today if someone doesnt like my work or a piece of work I do doesnt get the response Im hoping for I actually feel so psyched Its hard to explain but basically now I think its good to mess up and keep trying because Im not making stuff to feel validated Im writing and making stuff because I need to and if it was perfect every time that would mean I was being too cautious As for conjuring creative ideas themselves I wish I knew the formula Sometimes I wake up with an entire show in my head or a perfect joke Other times Im out hiking and I cant get back to my laptop fast enough because of some connection my brain has made between two different things and I need to explore it When Im backed into a corner I can often write my way out but I dont think that is the healthiest route for me as a person as its so stressful so I hope to become calmer and more organised as time goes by I can picture myself as an old lady just placidly writing absolute bangers from some small house by the sea and all the locals being quite nervous of me because the only time they see me is when the tide is high and Im staring at it and humming tunelessly Like many writers Higgins loves writing on trains I feel like Im already being productive because Im getting from A to B so any work I do is a bonus There is an ever changing landscape to glance up at The sound of a train is excellent white noise and youre not obliged to look at your phone so you can just do your work Irish train journeys specifically she misses The journey between Dublin and any other city being around two to three hours is an excellent block of time to sink into some solid work Trains she says are calming unlike air travel where Im convinced some of my molecules get lost in the atmosphere because Im hurtling so quickly through it She wonders if RTÉ would commission a show where I sit quietly on the train to Belmullet and just look out the window then write on my laptop What would this show be called Hold the Mayo the idea being I never get to Mayo I just get to sit on the train and write like those old people on the boat in Love in the Time of Cholera Identity in terms of nationality and place concerns Higginss work so much How does this translate personally as the classification of being a new emigrant starts to fade over time Being Irish somewhere else is a common circumstance and it has also provided Higgins with a lens through which some of her writing is filtered But its never about fishoutofwater stuff or arent people differences gas especially when Higginss personal philosophy seems to present the world as one big tank albeit one with levels worryingly rising she previously cohosted the climate crisis podcast Mothers of Invention with Mary Robinson On her relationship to the Irish State now Higgins articulates an irony in how she is supported by Ireland abroad but when that relationship is brought closer things change Its as though the connection to Ireland emigrating artists have is given much more slack as they travel away but the same metaphorical rope that both ties and leads snaps with tension when it draws closer to the island The Irish consulate is incredibly supportive of Irish artists and writers abroad she says They invite me to things and come see my shows and share my stuff on social media and when Michael D and Sabina Higgins were in town I was invited to a lunch and that is all so nice She thinks people are aware of her various successes and they are especially other female writers and those working in film and television here Its curious though she says because back in Ireland I cannot even get the national broadcaster RTÉ to read a script set in Ireland Like I literally personally emailed the head of comedy and the head of RTÉ a script set in Ireland and they assured me they would read it and then just didnt even read it or respond This is not a personal gripe truly its not I am doing fine that script is now in development in the US The reason I bring it up is that what I am experiencing I think is common for two groups of people Irish people abroad who get opportunities they are not offered at home who are then treated as some kind of miracle when they manage to do well after emigrating The second group obviously is women who are consistently overlooked and undervalued in Irish media which is also why so much homegrown content is bad The amount of talent wasted and potential unfulfilled bums me out to be honest and I dont know how to fix it for the women stuck in Ireland Nothing Higgins says is coloured by resentment shes merely observing the details of her experience and its a common one Later in a phone conversation she cites the departure of the hugely popular radio presenter Louise McSharry from as more evidence of the lack of the broader Irish media industrys acknowledgement and appreciation of Irish female talent One of the reasons Higgins potentially didnt get her dues in Ireland is of course basic sexism But one can only hope thats changing It does at least feel that the humdrum era of Irish comedy is no longer relevant Its hard to see where the meatandtwoveg lads can exist at a time when Joanne McNally is leaping ahead or Deirdre OKane is maintaining her queendom or a new generation of comics are eviscerating the Government in the kinds of sharp and hilarious sketch videos posted to social media And yet the biggest successes Irish women have experienced in writing comedy television in recent years Aisling Bea Sharon Horgan Lisa McGee appear to have been met industrywise with receptiveness opportunity and excitement elsewhere first Creatively Higgins continues to expand Shes holding back from delving into another big project just yet Theres a sense that shes at ease letting things happen and happy The title of the collection gleaned from a tragedy is maybe also a private thought of Higgins as the cover sees an illustration of her sitting in a subway carriage staring ahead with a smile Hannah Arendt wrote and spoke about amor mundi or love of the world says Higgins which is not just blindly accepting the world and people and not outright rejecting the world and people either rather trying to really see it as it is and understand it

250,../data/sec_IRL/Irish Times/Factiva-20230807-165,Weekend Marriage backlog forcing couples to defer or relocate weddings Post pandemic delays mean intending couples can’t tie the knot for love nor money Joanne Hunt Wörter März      A record number of marriages is expected this year as couples forced to postpone their nuptials scramble to wed Increased demand on State marriage registration services means some may be unable to marry this year or to do so in their county of choice There has been a substantial increase in demand and in delays for civil marriage ceremonies says a HSE Mid West region spokesperson The delays attributable to Covidrelated restrictions over two years are not unique to the Limerick Clare and North Tipperary region however and are hitting all registry offices The delays are impacting not just those marrying in a registry office but also the HSE appointments required to give notice to marry in any ceremony type All couples intending to marry must give three months notice to a registrar at a HSE Civil Registration Service But notification appointments at some of these services are booked up for months meaning some couples may have difficulty giving the notice required to marry this year In Limerick city for example no notification appointments are available until September Couples are being facilitated where possible with earlier notification appointments in Newcastle West Clare and North Tipperary But couples hoping for a civil ceremony in the Treaty City will have to wait until the end of the year as the citys registry office is now fully booked until November Civil ceremonies in Limerick citys registry office are held on Fridays only where typically four to six couples are married a week The registry office in Nenagh holds ceremonies on Thursdays only and has no availability until September In the HSE West region couples wanting to give the required notice to marry are waiting up to eight weeks to do so a community health spokesperson for the area has said The current waiting time for a notification appointment in Galway is eight weeks In Mayo the waiting time is six weeks As a wedding can take place no sooner than three months after the notification appointment this is likely to put pressure on registry office ceremonies and other ceremony types in the last three months of the year Waiting times for registry office ceremonies in the HSE West region are currently running at five to six months The Cork and Kerry civil registration service is experiencing a high level of demand for marriage registrations according to a HSE spokesperson for the area Marriage notification appointments at HSE offices in Adelaide Street Cork and in Killarney are available by appointment only but the online booking system shows there are no time slots available this year Couples are urged to contact these offices by phone the HSE says every effort will be made to accommodate them In Dublin one couple who sought in February to book a marriage notification appointment received a booking for weeks later in May at the Joyce House HSE office One of the earliest dates offered for a registry office wedding at Grand Canal Street was the end of September The number of marriages more than halved during the pandemic figures show In there were just weddings compared with the previous year according to the CSO Provisional data for shows there were just weddings in the first six months of that year compared with an average of in the first six months of Wedding planners estimate there is potential demand for weddings this year based on the number of ceremonies postponed over the past two years The type of marriage ceremonies that took place during the pandemic bucked decades old trends too During the first year of pandemic restrictions civil marriages accounted for per cent of all ceremonies up by more than percent on the previous year according to CSO figures The number of Catholic ceremonies in accounted for per cent of all weddings down per cent on the previous year The drop in Catholic weddings as a percentage of all weddings in is likely due to pandemic restrictions on large gatherings A breakdown of weddings by ceremony type for is not yet available Marriage courses Bookings for marriage courses were up per cent in January and February this year reports Accord the Catholic marriage preparation course provider It has been challenging to meet demand and our facilitators have doubled their delivery of programmes says Anne Coleman a specialist in marriage education Accord adapted to pandemic restrictions by delivering its courses using Zoom This had a welcome outcome of attracting overseas couples from Texas Sydney and Dubai says Coleman The Humanist Association which conducts secular ceremonies says its marriage celebrants are experiencing strong demand At the moment we have bookings for weddings so far this year Some of these bookings have been made since January says Kilda Taylor administrator and company secretary We will certainly exceed the number of ceremonies we did in The association is increasing its number of celebrants We have newly trained celebrants only gone on our books quite recently and they have a lot of capacity so at the moment we are coping well with demand says Taylor A further celebrants will complete their training by the autumn There is a growing demand for less traditional weddings We think we are in a reasonably good position to meet demand The association conducted almost per cent of all weddings in Turning another norm on its head December was the most popular month for weddings in according to records In the previous decade July and August have been the most popular months for couples to tie the knot The shift to December in that year reflects the postponement of ceremonies from earlier in the year and an easing of restrictions in that month 
251,../data/sec_IRL/Irish Times/Factiva-20230807-165,Finance Dublin Airport’s selfinflicted problems threaten to take off as aviation rebounds Mark Paul Wörter April      In between DAA agreed a deal that in the long term may have just as much potential to cause it problems The companys international division signed a contract to run the busiest airport in Saudi Arabia King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah where Muslim pilgrims fly to on their way to Mecca for the Hajj DAA launched a glossy new ESG environmental social and governance corporate responsibility strategy last year It is unclear how the new Saudi deal DAAs third major piece of business in one of the most politically and socially repressive states in the world fits in with this But the money surely is good Operational disaster Ironically DAA probably has been saved from greater public scrutiny of its latest Saudi deal by the sheer weight of opprobrium flying in its direction over the operational disaster that has engulfed Dublin Airports security operation in the last month Videos of hourslong queues snaking through the terminals have been widely shared on social media As travel resumes people here are far more concerned over whether they are going to make their flight than whether an Irish Stateowned entity thinks it is appropriate in to run an airport in Jeddah that has separate areas for men and women It seems reasonable to predict that DAAs links to Saudi Arabia may eventually be the cause of some trouble for the organisation Doing business with repressive regimes carries reputational risk and it is inherently difficult to predict when that trouble might flare up Just ask the businesses stampeding for the exit doors from Russia Two months ago they were all counting their roubles Now theyre in PR crisis mode as the public mood turns against them But for now DAAs biggest issue remains how to regain the trust of its passengers at home It is under heavy fire for the security queues at Dublin Airport for the working conditions of its security staff and for its handling of the wholly predictable surge in passenger numbers that appears to have caught airport management by surprise this week Even Taoiseach Micheál Martin has been critical of DAA this week That is never a good thing for a State entity DAA needs to get its act together and quickly Infamous reputation Prior to the opening of Terminal in the airport for years had an infamous reputation as the Black Hole of Calcutta a historical reference to a notorious overcrowded prison dungeon in the Indian city Ryanairs Michael OLeary was of course the first person to attribute the moniker to Dublin Airport during the Celtic Tiger years But the slur stuck because anybody who passed through the airport in the frothy years before the crash could attest to what a dire experience it was For a decade until the pandemic Dublin Airport was transformed into one of the more pleasant flying facilities in Europe With all of Aer Lingus and most longhaul and transatlantic services moved to the impressive Terminal the original terminal became much more tolerable The airport coped very well with the record expansion in inbound tourist numbers to almost million per year Dublin also was well able to cope with the business traffic flowing into one of Europes technology and investment hubs Dublin Airport handled almost million passengers in in relative comfort Certainly few were going around calling it the Black Hole of Calcutta anymore But now look at it prominent on the national news for the past week with footage of stressed passengers crying over missed flights and queues you wouldnt wish on anybody apart from maybe airport management Caught off guard DAA has blamed Covid cases among staff a tight labour market and new European Union background security check rules that have delayed the hiring of staff Its chief executive Dalton Phil ips also suggested it had been caught off guard by passenger demand that is much higher than we or other industry analysts had expected He said its own forecasts were out by per cent All that tells us is that DAAs forecasting is as dubious as its management of security queues There was ample evidence across the aviation sector from January that the rebound in traffic this year would be very strong Ryanair and Aer Lingus DAAs two biggest customers have been talking since last year about the elevated levels of pentup demand for travel Ryanairs OLeary has said he hasnt seen such a growth opportunity in or years Airline shares soared earlier this year as the relatively benign economic impact of the Omicron variant of coronavirus became apparent Irish aircraft lessor Avolon one of the largest in the world announced in January that it expected to be a very strong year with a return of at least per cent of traffic If DAA didnt see this level of demand coming it must not have been looking properly The real reason DAA is struggling to cope with passenger demand is that it let staff go on a voluntary severance scheme during the pandemic It is understandable that it wanted to manage its cost base conservatively during a period of uncertainty But it turns out that being so riskaverse was actually the biggest gamble of all and it has blown up in DAAs face It now has only security staff when it needs Compounding this DAA is now trying to rehire security staff on yellowpack contracts entrylevel wages that are comparable to supermarket workers with contracts that guarantee only hours per week but require staff to be available for fulltime work Out of nothing DAA has cooked up an industrial relations problem for itself The Taoiseach this week admonished DAA for not being worker friendly enough Trade unions now have the imprimatur to file additional pay claims DAA now having more paying customers than it says it expected is in a weak position to resist It has only itself to blame The prompt and efficient restoration of aviation traffic is essential to the social and economic recovery of Ireland after the pandemic The proper functioning of Dublin Airport as the main gateway to the island is a central element of this DAA needs to get a grip on what is happening before the summer rush or its public and political difficulties could spiral out of its control

chasm between candidates Lara Marlowe Wörter April      Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen resumed campaigning yesterday three days ahead of the French presidential election and following a heated television debate on Wednesday night Both candidates sought out disadvantaged voters who are likely to abstain in Sundays runoff Macron went to the immigrant banlieue of SeineSaintDenis the poorest department in the Paris region to talk about urban renewal Le known by its postal code as a hotbed of violence and radical Islam had the highest abstention rate in France in the first round ballot on April when the farleft candidate JeanLuc Mélenchon won per cent of votes there Le Pen travelled to the Somme and the PasdeCalais Frances second poorest region and a stronghold of her Rassemblement National party to talk about the cost of living the main theme of her campaign Opinion polls Opinion polls indicate that Macron is likely to defeat Le Pen by between eight and percentage points Most French media concluded the debate was a victory for Macron A poll by BFMTV showed per cent of viewers thought Macron won The candidates gave the impression of cordially detesting one another In the lightest moment of a contest that lasted just minutes short of three hours Macron remarked with a smile that they had kept to equal air time We are more disciplined than five years ago he said Were getting older Le Pen replied Macrons body language seemed to confirm accusations of arrogance and contemptuousness The incumbent leaned forward chin in hand his face registering dismay or incredulity He rarely looked at Le Pen Le Pen did not lose her composure as she did in the previous debate but she was on the defensive She repeated slogans such as France is its people and I want to give the French their money back while Macron provided spontaneous indepth analysis Five years of preparation improved Le Pens performance but she remains less at ease with economic technocratic jargon Macron criticised Le Pens fatal choice of an alliance with Russia Our choice is to defend Ukraine while remaining vigilant as I have from the beginning that this war does not escalate and spread Le Pen condemned the inadmissible aggression against Ukraine and praised Macrons efforts to resolve the conflict Why then Macron asked had Le Pens party systematically voted in favour of Russia and against Ukraine in the European Parliament Le Pen was one of the first leaders to recognise Russias annexation of Crimea in Since the second World War in international law one rarely recognises territories that are annexed by force the French president said Knockout blow Hours before the debate the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy and the Russian dissident Alexei Navalny stressed Le Pens closeness to Putin and said they hoped for Macrons victory Macron said Russian bank loans to Le Pens party were bad news for our country because you depend on the Russian government and you depend on Monsieur Putin When you talk to Putin youre talking to your banker It was the closest thing to a knockout blow That is false and dishonest Le Pen shot back saying the RN is reimbursing a € million loan cash on the nail every month No French bank would loan her money she added Striking the victims pose she added My party is poor There is nothing shameful about that The environment has become an issue because it is so important to Mélenchons voters Macron and Le Pen would both rely mainly on nuclear power plants but she rejects renewable energy sources You are a climate denier he told Le Pen You are a climate hypocrite she replied alluding to criticism of Macrons record by environmental groups Le Pen accused Macron of wanting to put wind turbines everywhere on all coastlines except for facing Le Touquet Macron and his wife Brigitte own a villa in the Channel port Are you kidding Macron reacted with an outraged expression The government has cancelled plans for at least a half dozen offshore wind farms including at Le Touquet due to local opposition In a sarcastic moment Le Pen attacked Macrons economic record recalling that he had been called the Mozart of finance in the previous campaign She accused him of increasing the national debt by € billion and noted there were more poor people in France than when he took office Macron attributed the entire € billion to the Covid pandemic Le Pen described Macrons plan to raise the retirement age from to or as an unbearable injustice because the French will no longer be capable of enjoying it Cost of living was supposed to be Le Pens strong suit But the candidates argued inconclusively over reducing VAT on energy versus capping energy prices and on incentives to employers to raise salaries You never explain how you will finance your projects Macron said You are not honest with people Doubled down During an intense exchange over crime immigration and the Muslim headscarf Le Pen said We are confronted with real

sequencing of ideas From a question on the headscarf you moved to terrorism returned to Islamism and then to foreigners You create a system of equivalence that conflates all these problems Le Pen had in recent days seemed to backslide on her plan to ban the headscarf which she calls an Islamist uniform But she doubled down on the objective on Wednesday night Macron said the ban would lead to civil

list of funny books Martin Doyle Wörter März      Funnily enough when the world is going to hell in a tumbril the last thing I want to read are Ten Terrifying Tomes about the End Times I want a list of books that are guaranteed to distract and entertain that will lift my spirits put a smile back on my face even make me laugh out loud I have always loved funny novels If the Famous Five the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew were my gateway drugs to thrillers and crime fiction then the Jennings series by Anthony Buckeridge and the William stories by Richmal Crompton led me to Evelyn Waugh Martin Amis David Lodge and Tom Sharpe his Apartheidera South African novels Indecent Exposure and Riotous Assembly are outrageously funny or they were to me when I was a teenager A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole Good Behaviour by Molly Keane and by Joseph Heller stick in my mind as comedic greats of my youth More recently I have loved Me Cheeta by James Lever the outrageous memoir by the real star of the Tarzan franchise Trainspotting by Irvine Welsh Then We Came to the End by Joshua Ferris The Restraint of Beasts by Magnus Mills The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao by Junot Diaz Love Nina and Man at the Helm by Nina Stibbe Problems by Jade Sharma and A Fraction Of The Whole by Steve Toltz I adored Skippy Dies by Paul Murray and The Glorious Heresies by Lisa McInerney Big Girl Small Town by Michelle Gallen The Road to Notown and Getting Used to Not Being Remarkable by Michael Foley are three dark gems from the North A littleknown gem that I read as a teenager is No Time for Work about a determinedly idle schoolteacher by George Ryan who was for years  bridge correspondent There are some great comic scenes too in Lead Us Into Temptation by Breandán Ó hEithir originally published in Irish as Lig Sinn i gCathú the only Irishlanguage book to top Irelands hardback bestseller list Here a range of writers share their own favourites Fintan OToole The first really funny books I read were Richmal Cromptons Just William series with their gleefully anarchic childs world in which adults feature only as the butt of the jokes They are still marvellous even if you are not years old The Millers Tale from Chaucers The Canterbury Tales is a tonic for the filthyminded It has sex religion literal arsekissing fart jokes and aptly for these times a screamingly funny burlesque of apocalyptic dread I also like it because the impoverished intellectual gets the girl an outcome that shows there is some justice Jane Austens Northanger Abbey is a real hoot a devastatingly clever parody of Gothic fiction Austens eye for folly is unerring but she is never misanthropic witheringly sceptical without being corrosively cynical A modern companion to it is Caroline Blackwoods hilariously creepy Great Granny Webster and the same antic spirit is abroad in Molly Keanes glorious Good Behaviour Roddy Doyles The Snapper is a delightful reminder of the comic joy that can be squeezed out of ordinary life even amid dark events But if you really want to get lost in crazy parallel universes the two great fictional worlds are Jonathan Swifts Gullivers Travels the first two parts are the most immediately amusing and Flann OBriens incomparable At SwimTwoBirds a cornucopia of exuberant parodies sly Dublin wit Rabelaisian jokes and barely controlled madness Fintan OTooles latest book is Three Years in Hell The Brexit Chronicles Lisa McInerney For warm belly laughs you need Terry Pratchetts Discworld series where ridiculous setpieces featuring literatures most lovable rogues flow into sharp observations on everything from social class to effective government You dont have to begin at the beginning Start with Pratchetts wonderful witches in Equal Rites or meet the extremely colourful cast of the City Watch in Guards Guards My own favourite is the divisive Monstrous Regiment This standalone Discworld novel may seem like a slight frivolous thing but between the puns and silliness theres deeper reflections on religion war gender and duty For readers whove already been to AnkhMorpork and back again I recommend Mark Dunns Ibid A tale told entirely in footnotes for a biography the authors agent destroyed by dropping in the bath demands a little effort but this hilarious oddity is well worth your energy This is most of the story of Jonathan Blashette an unluckyinlove threelegged circus performer turned deodorant baron and there is so much fun to be had making sense of Dunns daft but beautifullywritten asides Lisa McInerneys latest novel is The Blood Miracles David Hayden Comedy is a serious business Sparkling mordant and hilarious novels about death and life and death in life include Muriel Sparks Memento Mori Nicola Barkers fatally good Darkmans and Flann OBriens The Third Policeman Theres wisdom madness and hilarity in the short stories of Grace Paley Lorrie Moore Kevin Barry and June Caldwell The idea of classics as unfunny duty reads is easily dispelled by the comedic wonders of Henry Fieldings Tom Jones and Tobias Smolletts The Expedition of Humphry Clinke and yes Jane Austen is funny as well as witty Ishmael Reeds antic anarchic novels Mumbo Jumbo and The Terrible Twos are a tremendous tonic and forebears to Paul Beattys sharp and witty satire The Sellout Sylvia Townsend Warners wild and witchy Lolly Willowes and Barbara Comynss macabre Who Was Changed And Who Was Dead are comedic complements to one another Two underrated and very funny novels are Donald Antrims acute and strange The Hundred Brothers and Anthony Cronins sharp tale of exile and bohemia The Life of Riley The Parts by Keith Ridgway is a superb multivoiced portrait of Dublin and its sadness is shot through with irresistible dark comedy I have just read Eley Williamss forthcoming novel The Liars Dictionary a singular hilarious word drunk novel which I suspect will be seen in the future as a classic comic novel David Hayden is author of Darker with the Lights On Nicole Flattery As a young girl perhaps between and I was mildly obsessed with the film Sister Act which was a blend of my two interests at the time theatre and Mass It stars Whoopi Goldberg as a fake nun on the run who is always pulling at her nun costume as if to indicate its too hot and tight for a cool customer such as her Whoopi Goldberg When I served Mass I felt the same about my robes this exaggerated discomfort pulling theatrically at the neck while also trying to look pious I spent a long time trying to figure out what I liked about Sister Act good energy nice songs Whoopi Goldberg and what I didnt like about Mass boring Eventually I figured out what I didnt like about Mass was the total absence of silliness How could we take ourselves so seriously when we were all essentially in fancy dress performing elaborate dances Sister Act informed every single thought I had about religion until I was and read Patricia Lockwoods comic memoir Priestdaddy Priestdaddy is somehow both outrageous and highly sensitive both recklessly funny and deeply serious I would argue that no writer alive with the exception of maybe Donald Antrim can build sentenceby sentence to a punchline like Lockwood And she loves language Not in the dull reverential way that some writers love language She wants to play with it What Im saying is shes very silly I believe silliness to be an underrated quality Encountering Priestdaddy is the only time in my adult life that I recreated the incredible feeling of watching Sister Act Lockwood definitely would if it was required shrug off her religious robes and perform a bad rap When I read Priestdaddy in public I was laughing so hard that someone quite politely asked me to shut up Nicole Flattery is author of Show Them A Good Time Rónán Hession Alan Bennett has been funny for a long time though he would probably deny it He has had a celebrated career as a playwright and screenwriter but it is in his diaries that we get a sense of what his humour must be like to live with Like this from Writing Home December New York I am having supper at The Odeon when word goes round the tables that John Lennon has been shot This country of ours sighs my waiter May I tell you the specials Nora Chassler is the best writer youve never heard of Madame Bildungsromans Optimistic Worldview is a collection of tweetsized conversation fragments with a papiermâché dummy of an old woman Helpful advice for writers too A newly adored writer is a fun house mirror for readers projections a writer for whom its old hat is a corpse strapped into a roller coaster Twenty Fragments of a Ravenous Youth by Xiaolu Guo translated by Rebecca Morris and Pamela Casey is the zesty story of a young film extra in Beijing Heavenly Bastard in the Sky these cockroaches were sadomasochists looking for the most painful way to die Once I swallowed one absentmindedly drinking my tea Traumatised I rang the local chemist The voice on the line was gently reassuring cockroaches were not poisonous ingesting one would cause me no harm Though the chemist added in terms of protein they were not as nutritious as snails Rónán Hession is author of Leonard Hungry Paul Wendy Erskine If I was told that at the party I would be sitting next to a funny witty person my heart would sink a little at the prospect of an evening stuck with an exhausting and selfregarding bore I feel the same way about the comic novel and so prefer humour by stealth in books that dont set out in any selfconscious way to be amusing Jade Sharmas Problems although undeniably dark in subject is lifeaffirming in its singular funny perspective on the world My daughter and I can quote different lines at each other for a laugh I reread Good Behaviour by Molly Keane every year for the comically limited perspective of its monstrous and compelling unreliable narrator Aroon St Charles The Psychedelic Confessions of a Primal Screamer by extambourine player Martin St John is a fizzy brilliantly ramshackle book about being in a band St Johns love of music is totally infectious but more than that so many of the anecdotes and observations just crack me up The Henry Root Letters is a collection of spoof letters to establishment figures and includes quite incredibly their real responses I still find it funny It set me off on a spree of sending my own fake letters to various individuals Sorry in retrospect for that Wendy Erskine is the author of Sweet Home Adrian McKinty My goto funny book which is free and in the public domain is Three Men In A Boat by Jerome K Jerome This is the book that disproves the adage that humour does not age well From the same era Mark Twains The Innocents Abroad is equally hilarious and theres a fun bit on breaking a quarantine in Athens Youd have to have a heart of stone not to be amused by PG Wodehouses Jeeves and Psmith books and Evelyn Waughs first five novels are Wodehouse with a slice of sarcasm and bitter irony on the side Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett wrote in the Wodehousian tradition and Adamss first four Hitchhiker books hold up well If you like surreal with your funny I recommend Flann OBriens The Third Policeman and Hunter S Thompsons delirious Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas the bathtub scene in the latter had me on the floor Stunningly apropos to our present nightmare however is Ottessa Moshfeghs brilliant My Year of Rest and Relaxation about a young woman who refuses to leave her house for a year Lets hope it doesnt come to that but if it does her advice take a lot of drugs and watch Whoopi Goldberg movie marathons is probably one not to take Adrian McKintys latest novel is The Chain Martina Evans Humour is all about style for me so my favourite funny authors are serious stylists Wendy Erskines deadpan dry style is deeply funny her comic timing perfect Such a treat to hear her read from her story collection Sweet Home at Imagining Ireland in the Barbican this January Rachel Cusks gorgeous prose is studded with hilarious observational gems Her wicked comedy The Country Life combines Jane Eyre and Cold Comfort Farm along with the trueto life absurdity of Alice in Wonderland Just writing about it now makes me want to read it again Elizabeth Taylors humour is quiet but deadly especially in Mrs Palfrey at the Claremont Hotel Fine humour is dotted through her Collected Stories Flann OBrien is high on the list in particular that existential soufflé of absurdity The Third Policeman And because I have only room for one more PG Wodehouse the king of stylists In his essay Dingley Dell and the Fleet WH Auden described Wodehouse as an expert on Eden and it is true To slip between the covers of a Wodehouse novel is to wander into a strange blissful truth His characters cant be forgotten I recommend Summer Lightning and Joy in the Morning Martina Evans latest work is Now We Can Talk Openly About Men John Self One of the funniest novels Ive read is LJ Daviss A Meaningful Life which is undoubtedly a bit black as humour goes but very definitely funny think Joseph Heller or Kurt Vonnegut In laughsperpage there is one supreme champion The Onions Our Dumb Century which provides spoof newspaper front pages for the major events of the last hundredandsomething years including WORLDS LARGEST METAPHOR HITS ICEBERG TELEVISION PROMISES MASS ENRICHMENT OF MANKIND and HOLY SHIT MAN WALKS ON FUCKING MOON In this feature there may well be people above and below me recommending the various novels of PG Wodehouse They are all wrong his supreme achievement is Leave it to Psmith Accept no substitutes John Self is a critic Henrietta McKervey Who better for surefire laughs than the greatest comedian of the century Eric Morecambe Unseen edited by William Cook is a collection of diaries jokes and routines illustrated by a mix of family snaps and publicity photographs While both Morecambe and Wise were known for their insistence on perfection straight man Ernie could switch off once the camera stopped rolling whereas Eric a heavy drinker and smoker found it impossible to relax His diaries are full of sharp oneliners Fiddler on the Roof a one man show with about eighty in the cast Henrietta McKerveys latest novel is A Talented Man Declan Hughes The Information by Martin Amis about the unhinged rivalry between two novelists is a novel anyone involved in the literary life might find funny it consistently makes me cry with laughter However like the same authors Money or his fathers Ending Up or early Evelyn Waugh or all of Edward St Aubyn there is something a little too dark too savage too unsettling about it to work for me in the current unpleasantness others nerves might be stronger Theres Nancy Mitford of course and Anita Loos and Dorothy Parker and Nora Ephron The Best of Myles is maybe the funniest single book ever but everyone knows that Simon Grays diaries all eight volumes are ragingly funny and his plays hold up indeed weirdly they seem to work better now on the page than on the stage Richmal Cromptons William Brown stories still make me laugh as do Michael Bonds Paddington series and Willans Searles St Custards books But if I must identify as a grownup Ill plump for The Benchley Roundup Robert Benchley was a fixture at the Algonquin Round Table and a minor Hollywood star As a comic essayist writing in Vanity Fair and the New Yorker he seems to me to have weathered the years better than Thurber or Perelman his great contemporaries Ask That Man in which a husband exasperated by his wifes insistence that he seek travel directions from strangers undertakes to do the opposite of what he is told The Tortures of Weekend Visiting in which host and guest listen anxiously at respective bedroom doors for one another to rise as morning turns to night its gentle quirky arch observational middlebrow fare and its very very funny And its in print Declan Hughes latest novel is All The Things You Are EmerMcLysaght I wasnt yet thirteen and threequarters the first time I read The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole By that age Adrian had fallen in love with the treaclehaired Pandora befriended the elderly beetrootloving philistine Bert Baxter navigated his parents disastrous marriage and evolved from the sort of boy who had sand kicked in his face into the sort of boy who watches somebody else have it kicked in their face I think I was actually about elevenand ahalf when I first read Sue Townsends book and likely failed to understand at least a third of her razorsharp social observations ironic wit and wonderful turn of phrase In the years since Ive read Adrians diaries over and over again and each time I do I find something new to laugh at a fresh layer of humour and pathos Im only sad that Townsend is no longer with us and well never know what Adrian might have made of this pandemic but at least we have her precious words to return to to help us through the crisis EmerMcLysaght is coauthor with Sarah Breen of the Aisling series Frank McNally Measured in actual laughs a hard currency that has been devalued by the age of emojis the funniest book Ive ever read is Dave Barrys Complete Guide to Guys Its not what critics would call literature Its just a consistently hilarious overthetop study of the male psyche But of course a big part of the reason its so funny is that it also contains a disturbing amount of truth For many years Barry wrote a weekly column in the Miami Herald syndicated to half the newspapers in the US In the books blurb PJ ORourke called him Americas bestknown best liked most successful humor writer Speaking of pandemics ORourke added We would call him beloved if only he were older and had a fatal disease Frank McNally writes The Irishmans Dary in  Patrick Freyne The first grown up books to make me properly laugh out loud was Douglas Adams The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy based on Adamss radio series of the same name Its about a man named Arthur Dent who is rescued from Earth before its destruction to make way for an intergalactic superhighway Dent spends the rest of the story a fivepart trilogy travelling through space while dressed in pyjamas and a dressing gown It was the first time I realised humanist absurdism was a good way to cope with existential anxiety and potential catastrophe I wear pyjamas and a dressing gown a lot now Before I read these Id already been primed for solitary laughter by reading about Richmal Cromptons selfserious William Brown and Sue Townsends self serious Adrian Mole who are still now that Im an adult very very funny My wife Anna Careys excellent books for kids the Rebecca series and the Mollie books are cut from the same cloth In more recent years Ive been rendered helpless with laughter by Gideon Defoes brilliantly silly The Pirates adventure books and the epically petty I Partridge We Need to Talk About Alan and Nomad written by disgraced TV host Alan Partridge really Steve Coogan Armando Iannucci and Rob and Neil Gibbons My very favourite books Muriel Sparks Memento Mori and Shirley Jacksons We Have Always Lived in the Castle arent exactly funny but they have a dark sense of humour that makes me laugh especially when Im in a weird mood Im in a weird mood a lot these days Patrick Freynes OK Lets Do Your Stupid Idea is out in May Anna Carey All the books I really love even the most serious ones were written by people with a sense of humour If someone has a sense of the absurd I think it always comes out somewhere whether theyre Kafka or PG Wodehouse And the books that influenced my sense of humour the most are probably Ronald Searle and Geoffrey Willanss The Compleet Molesworth Richmal Cromptons William stories Sue Townsends Adrian Mole and Helen Cresswells Bagthorpe books I read them all as a kid but theyre just as if not more funny as an adult Ever since I picked up my dads copy of Very Good Jeeves aged Ive adored PG Wodehouse I read Great Expectations and discovered how hilarious Dickens could be When I was I fell in love with Nancy Mitford whose novels made me laugh and also taught me about the Spanish civil war Ive always had a thing for comic writing from the first half of the century especially ones with a streak of oddness and subversion two of my favourites are EF Bensons delicious Mapp and Lucia books featuring the joyfully queer Quaint Irene and EM Delafields sneakily feminist Diary of A Provincial Lady The more recent books that have made me laugh the most are Kate Daviess In At The Deep End and all of Nina Stibbes books Theres a bit about babies in Stibbes last novel Reasons To Be Cheerful that made me laugh so much I had to lie down There arent enough writers who can do that the ones that can deserve our gratitude and all the honours we can throw at them Anna Careys latest novel is Mollie on the March Conor OCallaghan Funny novels tend to be on the whole about as funny as a dose of piles Those novels I find funny are more than funny but that too Just finished Anne Enrights Actress Few reviews said how absolutely hilarious it is Enright skewers beautifully those creepy provincial aesthetes of Dublin of the and Elaine Feeneys justout As You Were is about a cancer ward but still seriously funny Feeney has a great ear for dialogue and the exchanges between women who might never have crossed paths are brilliantly done And from the vaults The Sportswriter by Richard Ford Achingly beautiful but also a riot A Sentimental Journa l overshadowed by Tristram Shandy is still Laurence Sternes funniest book Years ago I read Bilton by Andrew Martin The book disappeared but I still remember how hard I laughed A young journalist curates weekly lifestyle features such as Me and My Pen and What I Did Yesterday and his surly pal becomes a national celeb for throwing a cup of coffee at the PM Withnail I meets Scoop by Evelyn Waugh Easily worth the pennies it must now cost online Conor OCallaghans second novel We Are not in the World is out in April Sarah DavisGoff Like most readers I have weak points and blind spots I tend to approach new books so seriously so gravely that when I encounter humour I note it rather than just let myself laugh Its not a great trait Here are two books that were so funny I got over myself Its the toughest time ever to be a debut but Naoise Dolan is so talented I hope and believe it wont put pause to her success Ive been yelling about Exciting Times to anyone wholl listen its incisive touching and hilarious Theres a line in it wondering whether one of the characters a posh idiot is really a person or just three Mitford sisters in a big coat I still cackle whenever I think of it Heres what I love about Filter This by Sophie White its revolting and theres nothing as disarming or as hilarious to me as a description of a wannabe Instagrammer falling asleep with her hand firmly tucked into a container of curry chips Its light easy smart and has heart Also are we all listening to Sophies excellent podcasts The Creep Dive is my fave Sarah DavisGoff is author of Last Ones Left Alive Alan McMonagle Im presently addicted to a pair of brilliantly original comic novels from Mayo writer Michael Mullen Its another Mayo writers fault Mike McCormack Kelly is Mullens first novel The titular Kelly is chained to a rock in a field In his eye a maggot fattens Local healers apply a red hot poker and Kelly is suddenly imbued with fantastical powers Mullen is cut from an absurdist mosaic that includes Flann OBrien Rabelais Cervantes Boccaccio Gogol and Laurence Sterne His language is earthy lush sensuous elemental and bawdy And it is always funny A smorgasbord of farce absurdity wit ribaldry mayhem and anarchy The bedlam continues in Festival Of Fools Alan McMonagles latest novel is Laura Cassidys Walk of Fame Rachael English I first read Flann OBriens The Poor Mouth when I was and in Boston on a visa I remember sitting on the roof of our apartment building the sun blazing down and laughing until I ached Its a satire about Irish people and the Irish language originally written in Irish as An Béal Bocht Its dark and caustic and to this day Ive never read anything funnier Of course back then Peig Caisleáin Óir and all the rest were fresh in my memory Being a veteran of Leaving Cert Irish probably enhances enjoyment of The Poor Mouth but its not necessary Rachael Englishs latest novel is The Paper Bracelet Declan Burke Don Quixote is infamous for tilting at windmills of course believing them to be giants and the novel is laughoutloud funny as the deluded Dons adventures are recounted in a deadpan tone that cruelly parodies the excesses of the epic mediaeval romances Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes is the great comic novel the fons et origo of every kind of literary humour slapstick and farce parody social satire and surrealism since it was first published in Do your funny bone a favour and embark on the greatest of all quests with the selfstyled neverdeservedlyenoughextolled knighterrant Don Quixote de la Mancha Declan Burkes current novel is The Lammisters Claire Hennessy I guess you think you know this story You dont The real ones much more gory Roald Dahls Revolting Rhymes grabbed my imagination as a beginning reader so he will always be the king of comedy to me whether its Red Riding Hood whipping a pistol from her knickers or in The Enormous Crocodile the titular character being flung into the sun and sizzled up like a sausage That line was the funniest thing ever when I was a kid the sort you have to chant out loud each of the times you read the book sorry parents and even now I cant type it without the corners of my mouth going up Claire Hennessys latest novel is Like Other Girls John Boyne Whenever Im in need of a laugh I go straight to David Sedaris The American humorist has published many collections of essays and has a brilliantly skewed view of the world From his experiences as one of Santas elves to having a tumour removed by a reader who showed up to one of his events Sedaris lives an utterly bizarre life The funniest writer I know is Philip Ardagh While his work is predominantly aimed at children adults might want to check out The Silly Side of Sherlock Holmes and The Scandalous Life of the Lawless Sisters They will leave you

Whats so good about it Few innercity neighbourhoods have seen the dramatic transformation that Ringsend has in recent times Irishtown has benefited from the myriad developments within its nearest neighbour but has still somehow held onto its own longstanding residential charm and community With Ringsend and Sandymount on its fringes Irishtown is a relatively affordable slice of Dublin Famously Colin Farrell bought a cottage in Irishtown at the height of his fame and regularly retreats there when at home Overlooking Dublin Bay Irishtowns housing stock is made up largely of early houses and midcentury corporation flats Sean Moore Park Sean OCasey Park and Irishtown Nature Park provide great walks for locals Sandymount Strand is just on the doorstep The Grand Canal Dock is nearby for tech workers and the influx of moneyed new denizens has resulted in an explosion of cafes and gastropubs in the area Whats not so good Tesco Metro Mace and Centra serve Irishtown well but a big supermarket is the one amenity that is lacking in Irishtown If you want to do a big shop youll need to go to the Tescos in the Merrion Shopping Centre and Sandymount or the Aldi and Lidl in East Wall Irishtown can also be pretty quiet on the weekend but for some that can be a good thing Where and what to buy As one might expect during a global pandemic properties to buy and to let are scant On the market however is Irishtown Road € via Bergins a threebed twobath terraced house with over m of living space The property retains its original charm and plenty of period features but has been thoroughly modernised Elsewhere in Irishtown The Bottleworks € via JustProperty is a twobed twobath apartment in a popular gated development The apartment has been upgraded with air conditioning patio awning

hefty a price tag Onebedroom apartments can be rented in the area for about €€ Where to eat and drink A caveat to begin with given the current climate these eateries and bars are closed until further

Stephens Green Dublin Airport is accessible via the East Link toll bridge and the Dublin Port Tunnel with travel time about minutes outside rush hour The and Dublin Bus routes are regular while the Dart at Lansdowne Road is also nearby What do locals say I grew up in the neighbouring village of Sandymount and so knew Irishtown well before I bought my apartment here in My parents still live there so the proximity to them is a bonus For me Irishtown and Ringsend has everything I need shops chemists pubs gyms library and a great chipper I live right beside Ringsend Park which has public tennis courts a basketball court playing pitches and two playgrounds Sandymount Strand is a walk away and it takes me minutes to walk along the canal to work in the city centre The area has changed a lot in the years since Ive lived here The influx of the big tech companies means a lot of locals have been priced out of the area Despite that Irishtown still maintains its old Dublin village charm People still say hello to you on the street and the local Tidy Towns members are active keeping the place looking clean and bright with lots of flowers dotted about Niamh Kennedy underwriter

the pandemic and their hopes for life afterwards Jennifer OConnell Wörter April      The great lie we keep telling one another is that this is the new normal Because theres nothing normal about any of it People are giving birth alone People are dying alone and were attending their funerals via live online video streams Jobs businesses entire sectors seem to have disappeared overnight Were asking older people to lock themselves up at home Were delaying big decisions starting a family or buying a home or going to the GP to get that twinge checked out Were leaping into other ones launching new ventures working from home And in between deadlines and Zoom meetings some of us are rooting around for long forgotten memories of the aimsir láithreach On top of all this our usual support systems a yoga class a pint a walk with a friend a hug have vanished The only certainty is that this will pass But what kind of life will be waiting How will change our everyday world  spoke to people about how the pandemic has changed their lives and outlooks and what their hopes are as we emerge out the other side The mothertobe My baby cant be rescheduled The first time Maura McElhone remembers hearing the word coronavirus was in a family WhatsApp group in January Then it seemed like a distant threat possibly a bit of media hype not something that would cast a shadow over the final months of her pregnancy and the first of her childs life I was thinking the baby is not due until May Thats loads of time away McElhone and her husband Sean were on a babymoon in the Lyrath hotel in Kilkenny having a socially distant dinner in their hotel room when Leo Varadkar made his not all heroes wear a cape St Patricks Day speech on television You heard the emotion in his voice and thats when it started to register that okay things are getting real On their way home from the break she got a phone call to say that Sean would not be allowed to join her at the next antenatal appointment a routine scan Then because she has had an uncomplicated pregnancy the appointment was changed to a telephone consultation Now at the minute the restrictions are set to run to May which brings us to one week before delivery So Im preparing for the fact that Sean will be allowed in for labour and delivery and then I wont see him again until we are discharged from hospital Shes being philosophical and focusing on having a healthy baby and the fact that her family are all well but it has been a stressful time Work on a house they have been building on Seans family farm which was originally due for completion in August has come to a standstill I had a lovely weekend planned in the North for my baby shower They ended up doing a wee baby shower over Zoom instead Of all the challenges shes facing the hardest is the thought that her parents might not get to meet their first grandchild right away Thats really tough the fact that mummy and daddy might not get to meet them as soon as I would like But a babys always a source of joy What are her hopes postpandemic Ill be a mother all being well Its a brand new chapter And its a chapter thats happening imminently My baby cant be postponed or rescheduled This time is such a worry healthwise so I just hope in a years time my partner my family my baby and I are all happy and healthy She adds something you dont hear too often from expectant mothers she hopes the baby arrives late so theres more chance of life approaching normality Im ever the optimist so Im hoping that Ill go overdue The spiritual leader Theres a tailback of grief for an awful lot of people Funerals have changed radically says Very Rev Maria Jansson Church of Ireland Dean of Waterford Now I give a funeral in the church for only people which is so different for Ireland Ive had to learn YouTube After the pandemic there will be memorial services for people who died during this time but the emotional support for the family wont be visibly there for six months Ireland always did death very well Everybody turned up and the family were held for those awful few days after a death they were wrapped in this artificial bubble of conviviality and friendship where were laughing and crying sometimes in the same sentence Coronavirus has left a tailback of grief for an awful lot of people A man buries his wife and his mother cant be there This is hard Were experiencing other types of grief too the grief of separation from people we love When will I see the people I love again Thats the big question that has been striking everyone this week When she thinks ahead to life after the pandemic she hopes that ideally everybody will be alive That well recover what we do best which is caring for each other That well reach out to each other in friendship I think people have seen increasingly the emptiness of consumerism and all the effort that went into accruing money and status that all looks very facile now She hopes this period will give us a chance to recover an appreciation of the beauty of the landscape around us a proper sense of our connection with nature and proper sense of our connection with each other I would like if people recovered a sense of spirituality Im not worried about religion I dont give a toss about that But if people recover a sense of spiritual connection with life with wholesome values with God with nature with each other then something positive will have come from all of this The firsttime buyer Our outside space is a balcony the size of an ironing board I would have been on property sites every day having a look at where the fingers are going That hasnt changed for me says Aleesha Tully who has been saving hard for the past few years and was planning to buy her first home in The pandemic has thrown up lots of questions for Tully Theres the question of what will happen to property prices what will happen in the wider economy and how banks will respond whether for instance they will start asking for employer guarantees that an applicants income wont be affected Were really lucky in the grand scheme of things she says she and her partner are both still working with their incomes unaffected theyre healthy and their families are well Thats my biggest concern But there are days when you get a bit down with all the ambiguity I graduated from college about six months after the recession started So I had about three years of kind of doing unpaid internships Her peer group was already trailing previous generations in terms of being able to set in place the traditional pillars of adulthood Now theres even more ambiguity about when well kind of get to do all those things I just dont know if thats going to be delayed by six months or delayed by two years Living through the lockdown has focused her mind on some of her hopes We live in an apartment and it is a lovely apartment But we dont have any outside space apart from a balcony the size of an ironing board That has put the goal of a little garden at the top of my list The GP Half of my calls today have been related to mental health issues The Killester Dublin practice where Dr John Ball is one of seven GPs went over the course of two days from facetoface to nearly all phonecall based Our role changed very quickly because we were central to the referral pathway we were deciding who was getting tested and who wasnt and we were adapting to the national guidelines which were changing very rapidly as the virus progressed Its been a big team effort and everyones role has changed One of his concerns is that people may be neglecting other health worries I would stress to people that if they are anyway concerned about their medical issues to touch base with their GP because we are still open for business He is worried too about the prevalence of mental health issues postCovid At least half of my calls today have been related to that If you have a predisposition to it this time can be very challenging and a lot of the usual supports are not available Video consultations he predicts could become a more common part of practice life in limited circumstances for patients with whom the GP already has an established relationship As a GP you really value oneonone interactions There are a huge amount of nonverbal cues you pick up on and rapportbuilding that is at the core of what we do But in the future straightforward things like a review of medications could be done over the phone or over video A year from now when he looks back his hope is that we can say we didnt let the ball drop Thats going to be a bigger challenge as time goes on and our natural instincts kick in He believes this time will remind people of the things that really matter in life that they will really value their health value their ability to exercise and value the vulnerable people around us The music promoter I am never not going for a pint again Every Tuesday night for the last years music fans have gathered in Doyles pub on College Street in Dublin for the Ruby Sessions an acoustic gig featuring four live acts in a stripped down candlelit setting Every Tuesday that is until March this year We had an act from the UK and an act from Belfast Up to two hours before the show we still werent sure whether we could go ahead says promoter Conor Donovan who cofounded the sessions with Niall Muckian In the end we felt that we couldnt in good conscious go on its a lot of people squashed into a confined space So we pulled the show Even at that stage we felt like we might be jumping the gun Over the following week it became apparent that not only had they not jumped the gun the Ruby Sessions wouldnt be returning in its usual form any time soon by March Muckian and Donovan had put a plan in place for the first Ruby Sessions at Home Now every Tuesday two artists perform a free Ruby set which is then streamed on Facebook Twitter YouTube and Instagram at We treat it like a broadcast TV show we have a fiveday turnaround and a monster effort goes into producing it Nobody is getting paid for their time and all the money donated goes direct to the Simon Community Last weeks set which featured Saint Sister and Lisa Hannigan attracted views from places as far away as Malaysia and New Zealand and raised € for the homeless charity in less than minutes Other Ruby Sessions At Home have featured Villagers and Wallis Bird and Gavin James and JC Stewart Its opened up a whole new revenue stream where we can raise money for the Simon community remotely streaming it worldwide Its a game changer Theres no going back to normal gigs In the events space nothing is going to come back until September at the very earliest so thats a very scary time for people Selfishly its been great for myself to have something to do Thats currency for me Im blown away by the response says Donovan Im out of work and Im down on income but Ive reevaluated a lot of things in my life not just with my Ruby hat on Ive had the chance to think about whats important to me in my life Ill be spending a lot more time with my family Im exercising which is a shock even to me I think Ill be more social As one of my friends said I am never not going for a pint again The chef We need to have a big national celebration when we come through this Day one of week one we had a team meeting and I said to everyone were stopping interviews and were not going to fill vacant positions in the kitchen Day three of week one I had to tell them were going to a threeday week Day five we had to go to temporary layoffs says chef Robert Bullock of Le Patissier which had been supplying two million handmade desserts to the corporate sector and events as well as to Dunnes Stores Because so much of the business was corporate everything stopped The weddings were all gone I still had a stack of cream milk butter and eggs in the fridge So the following week he began selling direct to consumers via his website hastily adapted by a family member so it could take online orders Word of mouth spread mostly through social media and the orders were flooding in By week three the full lockdown happened so I had to start delivering myself My sons are in one of the vans myself and my partner Louisa are in the other van and were delivering all over north Co Dublin The dessert delivery service has been such a hit that after the pandemic well definitely continue in some shape or form Hes been using the extra time to develop a pastry tartlet shell for the home market The tartlets used here in the catering sector are imported from the Philippines For about three years Ive been talking about creating one for the island of Ireland When he looks ahead to April I hope I will be manufacturing the tartlet shell for the island of Ireland I hope well be back working with hotels and corporates And Id love the doortodoor deliveries to be happening nationwide and not just in Dublin He is hoping there will be an opportunity for a national celebration involving food producers and the hospitality sector We need to have a big celebration when we come through this just to say were back were still together lets support one another The teachers teacher Nothing will ever replace the magic of the classroom but children will have a digital schoolbag Primary teacher Ciara Reillys role as a lecturer in digital education at Marino Institute of Education means she was in some ways better prepared for the revolution of the past few weeks than many people although she never imagined the transition to the virtual classroom would happen so quickly My modules are going to be forever changed Throughout the closure she has continued teaching her own students online while juggling the care of her daughter at home and is also offering informal support to other teachers The day the schools closed my phone started buzzing immediately with friends colleagues former students asking for advice and ideas Before the pandemic the extent to which online learning was integrated into the classroom depended on the appetite of individual schools and teachers Children will come out of this period she predicts with a digital schoolbag an online space where they communicate with the classroom remotely For all her enthusiasm about the blended learning space she adds some notes of caution nothing can ever replace the magic of the classroom adequate funding will need to be in place for schools and that well need to ensure the education gap is not being widened further Its well and good for me to be talking about Gsuite which Googles videoconferencing Google Meet is part of for education or this app for the iPad but for some schools their priority is going to be the child relying on access to the food being delivered by their homeschool liaison teacher that week We have to be very careful that deploying these tools doesnt alienate the needs of those children further One of the things she has been struck by is how the arts culture and music have been key parts of the homelearning environment and she hopes the experience will consolidate their position in the curriculum For parents she says its a really challenging time Teaching is complex for us and were trained to do it Parents should focus on routine not productivity she says Weve had no map over the last couple of weeks Weve all been free

pandemic Maria AbiHabib and Zia UrRehman Wörter April      While clerics and governments across the Muslim world will greet Ramadan this week under lockdown working together to shut mosques and urging worshippers to pray at home in Pakistan some of the most prominent imams have rallied their devotees to ignore the antipandemic measures Ramadan which begins tonight is the holy month in which Muslims crowd into mosques and fast all day holding feasts after sundown with family and friends Those are ripe conditions for the coronavirus to spread and imams around the world are asking people to stay home But in Pakistan pandemic or no pandemic hardline clerics are calling the shots overriding the governments nationwide virus lockdown which began late last month Most clerics complied with the shutdown when it was announced But some of the most influential ones immediately called on worshippers to attend Friday prayers in even greater numbers Devotees attacked police officers who tried to get in their way As Ramadan drew closer dozens of wellknown clerics and leaders of religious parties including some who had initially obeyed the lockdown orders signed a letter demanding that the government exempt mosques from the shutdown during the holy month or invite the anger of God and the faithful On Saturday the government gave in signing an agreement that let mosques stay open for Ramadan as long as they followed rules including forcing congregants to maintain a sixfoot distance bring their own prayer mats and do their ablutions at home By the time prime minister Imran Khan met with the clerics on Monday deferentially promising to abide by the deal critics were demanding to know who was in charge during this national crisis the government or the mosques Totally subservient The state has become totally subservient to these clerics said Husnul Amin an Islamabadbased professor and scholar on Islam and politics It is very difficult for the state to implement whats best for the public good The larger public interest is always up against the clerics Its completely undemocratic Pakistans imams were empowered by the military during the when mosques across the country churned out jihadis to fight the Soviet military in Afghanistan with the support of the United States While other countries tried to curb hardline clerics influence after the Afghan war recognising the dangers they posed in Pakistan the powerful military continued to use them as tools of foreign and domestic policy But their defiance of the lockdown is exposing the limits of even the militarys control The military wanted the shutdown pressuring Khan to back the measure at a time when he was reluctant and worried about the economic toll But when the security forces tried to prevent worshippers from gathering at mosques for prayers they found themselves under attack In Karachi the largest city scenes emerged of worshippers chasing the police through narrow alleyways pelting them with rocks and sending several officers to the hospital The military has created a monster they can no longer control Amin said They are the creation of the military and only they could handle them That may no longer be the case By the time Ramadan approached police officers were no longer willing to erect cordons around mosques to stop gatherings for prayers While clerics acknowledge that their mosques are perfect vectors for the coronaviruss spread worshippers gather to perform ablutions together before cramming into the mosques shoulder to shoulder in supplication they say they have to protect their bottom line money and influence We know the coronavirus pandemic is a global health issue but religious duties cannot be abandoned said Maulana Ataullah Hazravi a Karachibased cleric And he added mosques depend largely on the donations collected during Ramadan That point money was high on the list of grievances that the clerics raised in their letter last week Worshippers open their wallets wide during Ramadan donating millions of dollars And in places like Pakistan where mosques are not under the authority of the state the money can make or break imams and the followings they try to build often to parlay into political power to challenge the government States authority Pakistani clerics have frequently used their religious authority to get loyalists to lay siege to the capital for example forcing the state to change policies they disagree with That differs from countries such as Egypt or the United Arab Emirates where the authorities give clerics guidelines or even specific remarks for their Friday sermons Clerics dont want to lose their social and political control over society They fear that if Muslims dont come to the mosques they will lose their power their influence Amin said The clerics observers said may worry that if the government forces their mosques to close during Ramadan using the pandemic from their point of view as a cover it could provide an opening to finally bring them under the states authority Take a back seat An editorial in the prominent newspaper Dawn demanded that the clerical establishment take a back seat and let the government manage the crisis This should not be seen as an affront to religion editors wrote last week Rather it is an attempt to save the lives of the general public But in private meetings with officials clerics warned that the state would invite Gods wrath if it restricted prayers during Ramadan Hazravi said code for the political chaos that imams have unleashed in the past While the government has given in this time healthcare workers have not Prominent doctors signed their own open letter Tuesday urging that mosques be ordered to limit attendance to five worshippers at a time On Wednesday they doubled down on their warnings at a news conference By Wednesday evening the virus had infected at least in Pakistan and killed some people according to officials Experts say that the true numbers are probably much higher and that the government is not testing enough The countrys barebones medical system stretched during ordinary times to fight preventable diseases such as polio and dengue is overwhelmed Doctors and nurses have threatened to walk off the job unless given basic protective gear such as masks and gloves Several have fallen ill with the virus and died With Ramadan approaching the letter from the doctors read we fear that allowing large congregations in mosques will increase the likelihood of infection But some of the faithful say they do not care about the science Muslims wait for this month for the whole year so that they can earn maximum rewards from God by fasting and offering our prayers said Hazrat Ali a worshipper in Karachi where many mosques defied the lockdown from the start If the government stops us forcibly from visiting the mosques we will resist he said New York Times 
275,../data/sec_IRL/Irish Times/Factiva-20230807-165,Ireland They’re in a panic because they’re making it up as they go along’ Unease is growing within the Tories and inside the UK government about its handling of the pandemic Denis Staunton Wörter Mai      When Boris Johnson addressed the Committee of Conservative backbenchers by Zoom yesterday the MPs unmuted their microphones so they could bang their tables in applause But this hightech display of obsequiousness could not conceal a growing unease within the party and inside the government itself about its handling of the coronavirus crisis A slide showing an international comparison of deaths from the virus was dropped from the daily Downing Street press conference this week as Britains official death toll surpassed that of every country in the world apart from the United States Ministers and government health advisers say it is too early to compare Britains death toll which stood at yesterday with others because no countrys statistics will be complete until there is clarity about total excess deaths throughout the epidemic But whether Britains toll is the second third or fourth highest in the world the governments performance during the crisis has compared unfavourably with that of most of its European neighbours Theyre in a panic because theyre making it up as they go along said Allyson Pollock a consultant in public health medicine and former director of the centre for excellence in regulatory science at Newcastle University Herd immunity Pollock is a member of the Independent Sage group of scientific and medical experts who this week published a report that criticised the governments handling of the epidemic and called for an expansion of public health capacity to identify isolate test and treat all cases Britain abandoned community testing and tracing on March limiting it to hospitals The following day chief scientific officer Patrick Vallance outlined the governments strategy Our aim is to try and reduce the peak broaden the peak not suppress it completely also because the vast majority of people get a mild illness to build up some kind of herd immunity so more people are immune to this disease and we reduce the transmission at the same time we protect those who are most vulnerable to it he said The policy changed again on March after modelling by Imperial Colleges Neil Ferguson suggested the mitigation strategy described by Vallance could lead to a quarter of a million deaths Ferguson did not model a South Koreanstyle strategy based on intensive testing tracing and isolation and Britain went into lockdown Weve been told to stay at home protect the NHS save lives Why should we be told to protect the NHS and save lives I mean I was always told that thats why we have an NHS and public services to protect us and to save our lives Pollock said But the government hasnt done its part which is it hasnt actually protected the very vulnerable whose lives they were meant to be saving and thats people who are older in nursing homes and social care Figures from the Office for National Statistics this week suggested that per cent of Britains Covid deaths have been in care homes but until March the official guidance said there was little risk there Pollock believes the government should have taken control of the situations in care homes in early February and imposed national standards on the mostly privatised sector obliging them to improve pay and conditions and increase staffing levels The clue to all this social care is you have to double and triple your staffing Theyve done that in ICU but they havent done it in nursing homes So you have to double and triple your staffing because thats the best way of doing infection control so that you have the same people looking after the same residents she said Two months after it abandoned testing and tracing in the community the government is poised to resume it next week with the launch of a contacttracing app and the hiring by a private company of callcentre operatives But Pollock argues that instead of trying to deal with the epidemic through centralised command and control it should swiftly restore the public health capacity of local authorities An epidemic is made up of thousands of small outbreaks all going on at different rates and pace and height in different parts of the country And I always use the fire brigade analogy If you had a fire in Dublin you wouldnt be calling the fire brigade in Westminster So you have to have your local outbreak team And the advantage of local outbreak teams is they understand their local communities she said Were a much more heterogeneous population than Ireland So what goes on in the Orthodox Jewish multigenerational community in Brent where there was a huge outbreak and Tower Hamlets with the Muslim community is very very different from whats going on in white elderly Devon or Exeter or Eastbourne and theres different sets of needs Youve got overcrowding so you might have to think about quarantine or isolation what support you give people Youve got language issues It begins and ends with the community Flimsy defence Despite the death toll the shortages of testing kits and personal protective equipment PPE and the muddled messaging surrounding the easing of the lockdown the Conservatives remain buoyant in the polls with a lead over Labour Johnsons personal popularity soared after his hospitalisation with the virus and he retains a net favourability rating of points This week however Labour leader Keir Starmers net favourability rating surpassed the prime ministers and recent polls show the public mood souring on the governments handling of the crisis Ninetysix per cent supported the imposition of the lockdown according to an Opinium poll But YouGov this week found the public almost evenly divided over the new rules announced by Johnson on Sunday and most Britons think the country is doing less well in the crisis than any other except the United States Political commentator Steve Richards whose book The Prime Ministers Reflections on Leadership from Wilson to May was published last year believes the current crisis is even more testing than the financial crash under Gordon Brown and Johnson is uniquely unsuitable to deal with it Here was a figure elected by his party because of Brexit winning an election because of Brexit choosing a cabinet because of their views on Brexit choosing a chief adviser in Dominic Cummings to preside over a kind of shallow but angrily espoused domestic revolution reforming the BBC the civil service and all the rest of it suddenly faced with something that he hadnt by definition thought about prepared for planned for And just objectively whatever you think about him on other fronts he has been wholly unprepared for this he said This is about a command of detail capacity to see that if you move in one direction there are consequences that also need to be thought through Now those all sort of played to Browns strengths as a workaholic obsessed with detail Not even his closest admirers would say that is one of Johnsons strengths The government has sought to identify the capacity of the NHS to deal with the epidemic as the central measure of its success in addressing the crisis But Richards believes that the polls tell a story that should rattle nerves in Downing Street What is so interesting about this crisis is that at one level you have to be a scientist to understand it but on another it is a much more accessible crisis than the financial crash or Brexit Elements of this are simple to understand I think the high death rate the promises to sort out PPE the pledges on testing that arent met all of these things I think are beginning to permeate now and polls suggest that the ratings although still high are falling and its quite interesting that Starmers personal ratings are going up a lot he said So I think that protective shield that helped at first that the NHS was not overrun is proving over a longer term to be a flimsy defence when there are so many other accessible statistics around to show that things are going wrong After weeks on the defensive there were signs this week that Downing Street is preparing to go back into attack mode and ramping up the rhetoric again on Brexit But although Johnsons advisers remain buoyed by the polling they pore over obsessively Richards says it is hard to see how the coronavirus story ends well for the government It looks as if however its portrayed that the UK will have one of the highest death tolls in Europe And the economic consequences are going to involve so many tough decisions that I think its quite hard he said And here there is another parallel with that even though some credited Brown with avoiding a sort of depression the decisions he had to take afterwards spending cuts tax rises and so on were unpopular So someone like Rishi Sunak is hugely popular now as he gives money away but he will have to take tough decisions which people wont like So I think its quite hard to see how this becomes a good news story for the government

against believers Lara Marlowe Wörter Mai      French poet Charles Péguy described Our Lady of Chartres as a star of the sea rising above oceans of wheatfields on the plains of La Beauce It is more prosaic to approach the Gothic masterpiece from the autoroute but its majesty is nonetheless stunning I visited Chartres because it falls within the perimeter of liberty accessible to Parisians under regulations The cathedrals website announced that it would reopen to visitors on the afternoon of May They would be required to wear masks Fifty could enter at a time if they observed social distancing The rules changed overnight The prefecture the arm of the interior ministry which is responsible for religious affairs grew alarmed at the prospect of Parisians flocking to the beauty spot to the southwest of the capital This is the contradiction weve been living with since the beginning of the epidemic said Fr Emmanuel Blondeau the rector and parish priest The state says Stay at home but go to work Were lifting the lockdown but dont move Dont go to Chartres which is the most beautiful town in France Instead of people only visitors are allowed to enter the sanctuary at a time The cathedral is open only for personal prayer and for residents of Chartres a staff member admonishes visitors in the queue Some drift away dejectedly A flacon of hand sanitiser and an offering plate await those who persevere Under lockdown there has been an explosion of digital life in the parish Fr Blondeau says Things we never imagined We didnt even have a newsletter Wed never had a televised Mass before We created a YouTube channel The cathedral has broadcast Mass live every Sunday since midMarch In normal times up to attend services Now click on the parish website and several are presumably watching in many households The videos are also available on demand from Frances main telecoms operators Fr Blondeau estimates up to people are watching and hes thrilled by the surge in his ratings Eighty people used to attend morning Mass on weekdays From the feedback I get I think about listen on radio Worshippers But relations between church and state have hit a low point When prime minister Édouard Philippe announced the partial lifting of the lockdown he banned religious ceremonies at least until June They dont understand what Mass means to Christians Fr Blondeau says They think it doesnt matter but it matters to us Parishioners are deeply wounded by the lack of freedom They feel disrespected Fr Blondeau could understand as long as the entire population was isolated Since May he says there has been discrimination against believers The rules imposed on the cathedral seem disproportionate especially when one considers the crowds in French supermarkets On Monday eveningthe Council of State Frances highest administrative jurisdiction ruled that the ban on religious ceremonies constitutes a serious and obviously illegal attack on religious freedom It ordered the government to lift the ban within eight days Im eager to say Mass in front of people with faces instead of empty chairs Fr Blondeau says The Conference of Bishops and the leaders of the Jewish Muslim and Protestant faiths are now negotiating conditions for resuming religious services It will be too late for Ascension Day tomorrow But Fr Blondeau thinks per cent occupancy or worshippers in Chartres cathedral would be a reasonable figure He hopes to hold normal services for the Feast of the Pentecost on May Patrick Delabre the cathedrals organist will play for the Ascension and Pentecost Masses whether they are televised or attended by the faithful Though he is isolated in the by organ loft Delabre thought it wise to stay home from midMarch He feared catching or spreading the virus If I werent a believer I couldnt do this job Delabre says Theres a commitment to the flow of the liturgy a receptiveness You have to feel it Delabre and his wife also an organist practised for up to five hours a day on their home keyboards during the lockdown I was able to channel my anxiety he says You forget the outside world You are alone with yourself I improvised a lot during this period Delabre doesnt know yet what music he will play for the feast days Things have been so morbid I think people will want something luminous he says Since he is a believer I ask Delabre why does he think God allowed the pandemic to happen He doesnt have power over events the organist replies thoughtfully The existence of God is essentially about a personal relationship Cosmetic Valley To go from the

refugees from Syrias civil war Kitchen Sink is more personal she says But the political angle is still there not far from the surface Im talking about gender politics sexism misogyny the policing of womens bodies Because a lot of it is written from my own point of view there isnt the weight of responsibility that there was on the last album Refugees the Syrian war the rise of nationalism you have to be responsible in how you talk about those things One of the subjects Kitchen Sink tackles is societal pressure on women in their Shah is to settle down and have children It is definitely a thing

grew up is very tolerant historically Its a port town says Shah You go down to Sunderland there was an awful lot of that racism that rhetoric present Then again these are very very poor people who

I initially wanted to be Labour leader says Shah But I am a supporter of the Labour Party So once he was elected Labour leader I endorsed him Before I actually liked Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham Im very very pleased right now that we have Keir Starmer I think hell be a great leader Was Shah surprised by Corbyns defeat to Johnson in December I wasnt shocked at all she says I loved so many things that Jeremy Corbyn stood for I didnt think that he would win If thats your Labour leader thats who you have to support You just have to Because I really want there to be a Labour government I wasnt

and country’s political culture Damien Cave Wörter Mai      Halfway into a Facebook Live video last week updating the world on New Zealands plan to reopen restaurants schools and even cinemas prime minister Jacinda Ardern noticed a concern cropping up among the commenters they thought she looked tired She had plenty of reason to be exhausted managing a pandemic as well as a young daughter But instead she blamed the unflattering beige curtains behind her then spun her phone around to show off the vintage cane furniture with green frond upholstery in her favourite room at the prime ministers residence This is a fabulous chair said Ardern who has become a global progressive figure plopping down after the brief tour And this is a much better corner because where I was sitting before was right next to the nappy bucket which Im going to admit was not the freshest place to be sitting So she continued after a deep breath when it comes to health services youll see those starting to wind back up Pandemics are often described as crises of communication when leaders must persuade entire populations to suspend their lives because of an invisible threat Watching Ardern on Facebook her favoured conduit is a lesson in rhetorical blending epidemiology brightened with empathy law leavened with mammy jokes And it has been strikingly effective Ardern helped coax New Zealanders our team of five million she says to buy into a lockdown so severe that even retrieving a lost cricket ball from a neighbours yard was banned Now the country despite some early struggles with contact tracing has very nearly stamped out the virus exiting isolation with just deaths and a few dozen active cases Halos But at a time when Ardern is being celebrated in some quarters as a saint when even a comedian imitating her says shes so nice that to make fun of Jacinda almost feels like making fun of a puppy a lot gets missed Halos can make heretics out of legitimate critics including epidemiologists who argue that New Zealands lockdown went too far that other countries suppressed the virus with less harm to small businesses And Arderns canonisation diminishes two powerful forces behind her success her own hard work at making connections with constituents and the political culture of New Zealand which in the overhauled how it votes forging a system that forces political parties to work together You need the whole context the way the political system has evolved said Helen Clark a former prime minister who hired Ardern as an adviser more than a decade ago Its not easily transferable Ardern who declined to be interviewed for this article is the product of a particular time and place She grew up in a rural nation of lonely struggle where demands were growing for a more responsive brand of politics In New Zealand was the worlds sixthwealthiest country per capita but by when Ardern was born it had slipped to And that was before freemarket reforms led to major job losses in manufacturing public service and farming Ardern the daughter of a police officer and a cafeteria worker who were Mormon has often recalled seeing forestry jobs disappear in the small town where she grew up leaving behind suicides poverty and illness including a case of hepatitis for her babysitter Alongside the countrys economic frustration the electoral system seemed to have broken down Several elections produced results widely seen as unfair with the popular vote going to one party and the majority of legislative seats to the other Breaking point It all reached a breaking point in when unemployment peaked at per cent and a national referendum asked New Zealanders if they wanted to remake how the country conducted elections They responded with a resounding yes New Zealand adopted a Germanstyle system that lets people cast two ballots one for a local member of parliament and one for a party Ardern was in secondary school when the first election under the new system produced what would become a trend gains for smaller parties and a coalition government Whether it is the worlds bestdesigned democracy as some government geeks claim Kiwis have been clear about what they want No single party has won a majority since encouraging a culture of cooperation moderation and openness There is more responsiveness required said Richard Shaw a politics professor at Massey University in Palmerston North New Zealand You have to be seen listening and in substance actually listening because you dont have the institutional wherewithal to simply ignore what others think That attentiveness is a vital component of Arderns leadership style what has come to be known as her politics of kindness Much of the world first saw Ardern in action after the Christchurch terrorist attacks when she stood with the Muslim victims of a white supremacist mass killer and declared They are us The person who has perpetuated this violence against us is not The urge to draw people into an us rather than an us versus them has served New Zealand well during the coronavirus pandemic when truly everyone is being threatened It follows an evolution in how Ardern speaks and handles leadership Only a few years ago she presented herself as a much more conventional politician posting videos about homelessness social workers or a new bike repair station With her election victory however she seemed to emerge from the constraints of what might be expected from a typical male politician She quickly became a leader who could talk policy from a podium dress down a sexist commentator on camera or post a Facebook video encouraging a rugby team while the cat on her lap struggled with a plastic lampshade collar Nap time In June she opened up even more to her audience with a Facebook Live of herself leaving the hospital with her newborn daughter Neve She was the first female world leader to give birth in office since Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan in The comments pouring in were overwhelmingly positive but hinted at high expectations Get some rest and enjoy her before you get back to work one woman wrote Her response was not to hide from critics who questioned whether she could do the work of both a mother and a world leader She made them watch When Ardern returned after about six weeks her Facebook presence became more active a flood of scenes from home and work as she communicated her way through the challenge She felt she had to hit the ground running said Clark the former prime minister who has stayed close to Ardern There was a lot of meanspirited criticism the parttime prime minister hashtag which would never have been said about a man Around this time Ardern started doing weekly updates often from home mixing comments about nap time with details about poverty or transportation legislation With each update she got better at boiling down government into a conversation you might hear over dinner They became a model for how she has communicated online during the pandemic In her most popular Facebook Live video from just before the start of the lockdown on March million views and counting Ardern appeared in a faded green sweatshirt after putting Neve to sleep Her elbow on her knee she asked everyone to be kind Stay at home break the chain and youll save lives she said It was the start of a relationship that was less saint and disciples more friends or teammates Youll be seeing me lots and lots she told the people tuning in Misinformation And they have In addition to daily briefings with public health officials Ardern also started hosting her own questionandanswer sessions with experts which she used to target misinformation and she deployed Facebook Live updates to respond to questions from commenters Her popularity her halo has sometimes seemed to blind her fans to deeper problems New Zealand started out with little contacttracing capacity and fewer ICU beds per capita than most developed countries The government struggled to work through requests for exceptions to the lockdown And epidemiologists say the shutdown may have caused undue harm to businesses without corresponding benefits to public health The harder you push your lockdown the more you get unintended consequences said Simon Thornley of Auckland University If you want to separate people more effectively then you have to keep more of the food and services open more of society open so people dont congregate Thornley said he worried that a second wave of infections would lead to another overly harsh response But he noted that Ardern had been quick to listen and pivot allowing gatherings of up to people sooner than Australia and many other countries that have eased lockdowns It reflects something that Ardern has talked about a lot in her most recent Facebook videos agility With unemployment soon expected to reach nearly per cent and with a federal election scheduled for September the next phase of New Zealands coronavirus response will require Ardern to do a lot of adapting and explaining Facebook will be where to find her In her video detailing eased restrictions Ardern who did look tired even in her favourite chair promised viewers she would stay in touch Thanks for joining me she said smiling And look after yourselves New York Times

Hutcheson from Belfast but living in Dublin Pope Franciss Urbi et Orbi on March where he preached on the story of the disciples and Jesus in a boat on the Sea of Galilee when a storm threatens to

Ballaghaderreen Co Roscommon Faith is stronger than God Science and all the big powers are helpless and saying stay inside to protect yourself and others I never imagined Id see such times but the

from Larne Co Antrim He says reminds him of the three young visionaries at Fatima Two of these young children died of Spanish flu in the pandemic and the other spent the rest of her life in a monastery Two were declared saints and the other is in the process Simply put it reminds us that we have been given free will to choose the path of God and do good or follow the path of the evil one and choose to live eternally without God The message is partly about warnings of chastisements that will be drawn upon the world due to apostasy from the faith and unbelief Jim OConnor from Boyle Co Roscommon Either nature or man is responsible for the virus I expect science will have the answer in time No doubt many will blame the God of their understanding for us being naughty in some way or another My mind goes back to the Aberfan disaster in in Wales where people mostly children died when God was blamed but it was the coal board who got the rightful blame within a year or two I find it hard to believe in which God might be responsible so I will stick to science Monica Cox from Newbridge Co Kildare Organised religion has not been part of my life for the best part of years At the same

282,../data/sec_IRL/Irish Times/Factiva-20230807-165,Weekend A RECKONING FOR THE US AND ITS PRESIDENT Mass protests are forcing the United States to confront its racial history in what could be the defining moment of the presidential election Suzanne Lynch Wörter Juni      Memorial Day is traditionally the start of summer in the US a time when Americans look to the long sunny days ahead and head to parks and beaches But for George Floyd the last Monday in May had a very different outcome The man took his last breaths as he lay on the side of a curb in Minneapolis Video footage filmed by a passerby captured the shocking scene of a white police officer pressing his knee into Floyds neck as he begged for his life repeating the words I cant breathe until his body grew lifeless His alleged crime was to use a counterfeit € bill in a grocery store He paid for it with his life Within days America had plunged into turmoil Protests which began in the midwestern city of Minneapolis soon spread nationwide By last weekend thousands of people had taken to the streets Curfews were imposed on cities from coast to coast More than states deployed the National Guard to back up police as mostly peaceful protests slipped into violence Buildings were attacked and businesses looted From New York to Chicago and Los Angeles Americas deep wounds of racial and social inequality erupted with a ferocity that few saw coming In normal times this would call for a moment of leadership But the presidency of Donald Trump is anything but normal Every US president has their crises For George W Bush it was and Hurricane Katrina Bill Clinton was faced with the Oklahoma bombing during his presidency The financial crisis of dominated Barack Obamas first term Trump is now facing the most dramatic scenes of social unrest since the civil rights and antiVietnam War marches of the While most presidents would seek to unify the nation Trump turned to the impulse that has been the guiding force of his presidency division After reading prepared remarks sympathising with Floyd he politicised the crisis branding the protesters as radical left looters and thugs and linking this characterisation to his Democratic election rival Joe Biden Casting himself as the president of law and order he presented the scenes unfolding on Americas streets as an usversusthem narrative arguing that those protesting were a threat to the American way of life and that a vote for Biden would be a vote for chaos This narrative of the enemy within culminated on Monday night when his administration ordered police to turn on US citizens as they protested peacefully outside the White House In extraordinary scenes Trump and his entourage left the White House compound by foot and marched across Lafayette Square Minutes earlier police on horseback had forcibly removed the peaceful protesters so that Trump could appear before St Johns Episcopal Church As he held up a Bible and posed for pictures US citizens came under attack by their own police force nearby The fictional American carnage that Trump had vowed to end in his inauguration speech was now unfolding around him But even as the president bathed in the defiance of the moment uncertainty began to set in as church leaders and commentators blasted his photo op outside the church As the week went on dissent grew Most Republicans on Capitol Hill scurried away when pressed by reporters for their views Republican senator Lisa Murkowski said she would struggle to vote for Trump in November Defence secretary Mark Esper said he disagreed with Trumps threat to deploy the US army to states across America His predecessor James Mattis a respected fourstar general excoriated the president Trumps presidency is now facing a reckoning over Americas racial history amid mass protests five months before a presidential election Over the past years something of the essence of Trumps remarkable political success has been lost in the relentless dysfunction and chaos Lies attacks on the media friendly exchanges with Kim Jongun the suggestion that ingesting bleach could combat a novel coronavirus and an endless list of outrageous pronouncements and actions by the businessmanturnedleader of the free world have clouded what is a very simple fact that much of the success of Donald Trump was based on racism Though Trump in expressed legitimate economic grievances among white workingclass Americans about trade policy much of his success was a reaction to the presidency of Obama the first AfricanAmerican president Trumps promulgation of the birther theory that Obama was not born in America his subsequent introduction of a ban on travel from some Muslimmajority countries and edict that four American congresswomen of colour should go back to their countries have been a constant drumbeat throughout his political career The president is not solely to blame His instinctive ability to play to the lowest common denominator and appeal to peoples worst rather than best instincts is his skill as a politician and communicator To really understand the race protests that have erupted in these past weeks one needs to go back much further The events of the past few weeks have crystallised something that has been a long time coming stretching back to the original sin of America The Deep South Ten hours drive south from Washington DC through the southern states of Virginia and North and South Carolina a sign reads Welcome to Georgia This is the Deep South Just over the South Carolina border lies the city of Augusta Famous for the golf course on the edge of the town the city has a grittier edge than the greens and azaleas of Augusta National evoke Like many US cities the downtown area has seen better days As Georgias second biggest city Augusta experienced the white flight of the and which saw many white families fleeing to the suburbs establishing a geographical racial divide that still exists The main thoroughfare has hints of southern charm Faded shop windows and restaurants line the sleepy streets which have been markedly affected by the recent coronavirus lockdown though Georgia was one of the first states to reopen under Republican governor Brian Kemp But the city also speaks of a commerce in a different time The Savannah river that meanders along the edge of the town all the way to the port city of Savannah was once a bustling trade route As the old warehouses that still stand along the river banks indicate its main commodity was cotton Following the invention of the cotton gin in Georgia in the late century cotton production took off in the south Georgia was soon the nations biggest producer powered by a massive slave population Plantations developed across the rich fertile land of Georgia built on the servitude of AfricanAmericans For every whitepillared manicured house that dots the lush southern landscape of Georgia today there are remnants of a parallel history the slave blocks in Savannah and Augusta where slaves are believed to have been bought and sold For every Confederate monument there are more than across the state slave stories and songs exist telling another version of the past The whitewashed version of plantation life glorified in Gone With the Wind a film set in Georgia is no more than an epic romance built on Hollywood dreams Here in Augusta the protests that have rocked America have made their way to the dusty streets Im happy to say that weve had four protests and theyve all been peaceful says Augustas AfricanAmerican mayor Hardie Davis jnr as he reflects on the demonstrations that have rocked the state capital Atlanta away With the death of George Floyd however we have reached a tipping point in America he says Like many AfricanAmerican leaders he worries about what comes next If were going to protest we have to protest with purpose we have to come together for real change he says Part of what is being lost in this conversation as people protest across the country is the challenge of what is the end result what is the end goal He says that while race relations have improved in Augusta the city has a per cent AfricanAmerican population cases such as George Floyds reveal the deeper biases that still exist Many people perceive progress in terms of race as simply electing more black people he says The election of Barack Obama not once but twice in my mind allowed us to take a step forward in making it known that AfricanAmericans are capable of holding the highest offices in this land can lead a nation not just cities and states But many people then thought well weve solved the race issue in this country And thats just not true These things cant be onceoffs There has to be structural change Racial inequality More than years after the death of Georgia native Martin Luther King it is clear that America is far from the land of racial equality he envisioned Just a few hours south of Augusta a unarmed black jogger Ahmaud Arbery was shot dead on a Sunday afternoon in February Three white men have been charged and their trial began this week Data shows that race is still the biggest indicator of social and economic health in the US Though the gap has narrowed in recent years black people are twice as likely as white people to be unemployed a discrepancy accentuated by the coronavirus pandemic which has disproportionately affected the black community who tend to have less secure jobs and poor health coverage Racial inequality is also endemic in the criminal justice system From the racial profiling that was exposed so graphically by Floyds death to the disproportionately high number of AfricanAmerican men in prison institutionalised racism exists at every stage in the criminal justice system According to writer and academic Michelle Alexander black men have been admitted to prison on drug charges at rates to times greater than white men in some states Many blame the crime Bill introduced during the Clinton administration which cracked down on crime and ultimately led to a period of mass incarceration in America But despite the bleak picture on race relations there are also signs of change Georgia is at the centre of a vibrant movement to increase minority voter participation in elections an issue that could have a profound impact on Novembers presidential election Gerrymandering along racial lines is alive and well in the US Many egregious examples have reached the supreme court In federal judges ruled that North Carolina lawmakers had racially gerrymandered districts when they redrew a congressional map in Similar cases have emerged in Texas Wisconsin and elsewhere The political ramifications are crucial because most AfricanAmericans vote Democrat the racial politics of voting rights can have a bearing on elections Stacey Abrams an AfricanAmerican woman who narrowly lost the Georgia governors race to Kemp in has spearheaded a campaign to improve voting access in the state She argues that the Republican leadership in the state has suppressed the votes of hundreds of thousands of people by making it more difficult to vote either by purging names from the electoral register making people queue for more than four hours or introducing overly onerous voting ID requirements Election day Back in Washington states such as Georgia are being watched closely as election day approaches Recent polls suggest that Trump may face the fight of his life on November A Monmouth University poll this week showed Biden ahead by points nationally a lead that has been steadily increasing in recent months While both election campaigns are focusing on swing states such as Florida Ohio and Pennsylvania that traditionally make or break elections Democrats are quietly hopeful that other states may be in reach One of those is Georgia Some believe the electorallyimportant red state reliably Republican for decades could turn blue in Novembers election The outcome is not just dependent on a higher turnout by minorities Republican strategists are now deeply worried about the suburbs of Atlanta The upmarket neighbourhood of Buckhead Atlanta with its Jimmy Choo stores and SUVs was traditionally solid Republican territory But it along with the neighbouring Cobb County and Gwinnett County voted Democrat in the midterm election Polling shows that many moderate Republicans particularly women are increasingly uncomfortable with the party under Donald Trump Many believe that the election could be won or lost in suburbs such as these from Atlanta to Phoenix to Dallas An increasingly worried Trump campaign is rampingup its focus on these new swing states Vicepresident Mike Pence visited Georgia twice in recent weeks As well as its electoral college voters two senate seats currently held by Republicans are on the ballot and could be in doubt With the election still five months away a lot can change and Trump has a formidable war chest and social media campaign strategy Nonetheless Trumps increasingly erratic behaviour from his poor handling of the pandemic to his wild allegations that a prominent TV host was involved in a murder to this weeks militarisation of Americas streets is alienating many except his core base Biden may not be the perfect candidate his recent You aint black comment to a highprofile radio presenter illustrates his challenges in appealing to young black voters for example but the current crisis plays to his strengths such as natural empathy and decency in the eyes of many people With most Americans outside Trumps core base exhausted by years of his presidency many will vote Democrat whoever the candidate The desire for someone who can steady the ship may be enough to get people to the polls Whether the current racial and social turmoil will become the defining moment of this campaign remains to be seen But there was a sharp contrast this week between the responses of Trump and Biden who delivered a gracious speech in Philadelphia City Hall this week calling for leadership and unity The election of Donald Trump in was at some level a reaction to the election of the first AfricanAmerican president but the pendulum always swings back This weeks events could well mark the moment Trump lost the election

287,../data/sec_IRL/Irish Times/Factiva-20230807-165,Sport Croke Park seem determined to embark on a modern civil war Seán Moran Wörter Juli      The strange mirroring of the century continues Having marked the rough centenaries of pandemic and disrupted championships the GAA now seems determined to embark on a modern civil war Like many civil wars its rooted in a rejection of the prevailing order and the apparent powerlessness of authority to enforce its writ throughout the land It is dispiriting beyond measure After the anxieties of lockdown and the community contribution made by clubs up and down the country there emerged the simple symbolism of allowing those same clubs centre stage for eightandahalf uninterrupted weeks It has been met with the rejection of county managers and the indifference of administrators As Offaly chair Michael Duignan said on talk last Monday We had a chance to say community and family comes first and being with your own people comes first and what we have done is weve jumped straight back into the intercounty rat race The affliction of living in interesting times has agitated rather than tranquilised the county management corps and one supposes that in football the prospect of suddendeath championship fixtures has been concentrating minds wonderfully Nostalgic glow Unwittingly and perhaps bathed in the nostalgic glow of oldstyle knockout with no second chance the GAA has also shone a bright light on the rationale behind qualifiers in the first place the creation of a more stable balanced championship Without those safety nets we get to see the daftness of the old system Noones arguing that there was room for anything else in a few weeks at the end of this year assuming public health issues havent reasserted themselves but when two heavy hitters like Tyrone and Donegal are drawn together the lack of a second chance further electrifies the fixture and leaves one of the top six sides from the past two years out in the cold literally Anyway theres hardly a county you talk to where the senior team isnt said to be training surreptitiously and even one where you can get confused between a training camp and a challenge match no no that was the previous week Then there are the ones who are minded to obey the rules but are being driven to neurosis by the strong suggestion that the other crowd are at it three times a week down the local silo How did this happen Well it was greatly facilitated by restrictions Normally the bigger part of county championship scheduling happens after the AllIrelands are done but this year with the improvised schedules its the other way around and tugsoflove are taking place over players claimed by both club and county Some clubs wont have it and some will be more diffident but as a showcase of the club as the essential unit in the association its been as decorous as fisticuffs at a Feis The two player organisations are shaping up for confrontation The GPA were recently looking for their members insurance to be reinstated to cover the weeks before the permitted return to collective training in midSeptember refused by the GAA and the CPA calling for drastic penalties to be imposed on any county doing so a proposal of limited appeal to Croke Park Delinquent behaviour Both have their reasons The intercounty union is reflecting the views of its members players who want to train with the county and cant understand the restrictions whereas the CPA knows the old rule of deterrent if its hurts hard enough the delinquent behaviour will stop County administrators are stuck between humouring the manager and protecting the club season as outlined after all just a couple of weeks ago There tends to be just one winner in those disagreements although there have been signs recently that some clubs are getting fed up The position of Croke Park has been curious Having not alone selected the date September for the return of county training but any time queries have been raised defended it vehemently the national administration has been ineffectually equivocal about enforcement Director general Tom Ryan did raise the faint prospect of dealing with the issue but in a determinedly Augustinian way raising the possibility that he may not have been talking about this season at all Slowing down It is believed that a major report will issue before the end of John Horans presidency with the purpose of if not derailing then certainly slowing down what one official has referred to as the runaway train of the intercounty game The only way of achieving such a goal would be to make breaches of regulation and guideline a lot more trouble than theyre worth something that everyones beginning to accept wont happen this year Even with a bit of conviction this wont be easy The Managers Charter from was intended to regulate relations between counties and managers for the benefit of club schedules Within a couple of years halfhearted engagement was being diagnosed as the reason behind the initiatives lack of impact Payments to managers Coincidentally the idea of the charter originated in former DG Páraic Duffys discussion document on the issue of amateur status and payments to managers which in turn was inspired by a speech from historian Professor Gearóid Ó Tuathaigh at an event for NUIG graduates to mark the GAAs anniversary Ó Tuathaighs contention was that widespread irregular payments to managers constituted a huge challenge to the GAA He cited the fall from grace of the Roman Catholic Church within Irish society as a warning of what happens to institutions that chronically fail to practise what they preach and fail to punish those who breach their rules That is largely where Croke Park currently stands on the club issue It introduced and defended a starting deadline for the county season but at the same time has declined to enforce it which in GAA terms is effectively incentivising bad behaviour A couple of fractious months are on the horizon but they will provide any new committee tackling the clubcounty interface with a pile of ammunition smoranirishtimescom

border separating Spain and Morocco was created At the time a cholera epidemic was taking place in the Moroccan territory near Melilla and the Spanish authorities in order to prevent contamination in

fewer migrants jumping the barrier but they will arrive in Spain by boats or hiding in vehicles one member of the Spanish Guardia Civil of Melilla said According to UNHCR in only per cent of more than arrivals from Morocco to Spain crossed the land border to Melilla and the other Spanish city on the northern Moroccan coast Ceuta People used to enter Melilla dreaming of freedom and safety hidden in cars or trucks with false Moroccan identity papers Some jumped over the fence or crawled through water pipes This tiny Spanish town of people has been a major crossing point for Moroccans living in the nearby cities of Nador and Beni Enzar who could benefit from a visaexemption regime to enter Melilla freely during the day As a result more than people ie almost onethird of the population of the enclave used to cross daily to work and earn a living there But last March as the effects of coronavirus started spreading worldwide the Moroccan authorities ordered the shutdown of the border crossings that connect the Spanish enclave with their country Many Moroccans have since been waiting for the border to reopen Some have been sleeping in the open air or at Melillas Muslim cemetery stranded for months in a state of stress and anxiety only asking for one thing to cross the border and go home Comercio Atípico Coronavirus put an end to the comercio atípico atypical trade a widely used term in Spanish to describe the organised smuggling of merchandise across the border There is no official commercial frontier between Melilla and Morocco just this practice widely acknowledged to be hypocritical and exploitative yet effectively endorsed by authorities on both sides For almost a decade by now the ritual has been the same At the pedestrian border of El Barrio Chino hundreds of people have been involved from Monday to Thursday in transporting smuggled goods from Melilla to Morocco Melilla and Ceuta are not included in the EU customs territory and can import goods at lower tariffs than the rest of the EU Goods that arrive in the port of Melilla virtually taxfree are brought into Morocco informally bypassing any official trade or tax regulations Women are used by smugglers to carry bundles across the border of up to earning an average of just € a day Their packages are classed as personal luggage and are therefore duty free Many are single mothers widows or divorcees young and old who have to make a living to maintain their families in Morocco They are known as porteadoras Invisible and excluded shamefully exploited as a means to transport contraband goods and often pejoratively referred to as mule women They are unable to escape a cycle of exploitation and left without any other options to survive As they arrive at the Moroccan customs officials symbols and numbers on their packages identify the goods as the property of wholesale smugglers who have made regular payments to the authorities These goods are declared as basic needs items like milk sugar blankets but are often in fact goods such as mobile phones and other electronic products of much higher value Some Moroccan authorities take bribes many women testified as well as act in an arbitrary way one Spanish official working at the border said The goods carried by the porters are estimated to amount to between € million and € million per year According to the American Chamber of Commerce of Casablanca about people live directly from this atypical commerce per cent of them women Including those affected indirectly by the trade that estimate rises to people One in three Moroccan graduates is jobless Due to the countrys high rates of unemployment men have started working at the border too The closure of the border has exposed Melillas singular dependence on Morocco Last week Morocco was included on the EUs list of countries around the world now deemed safe for travel but Eder Barandiaran spokeswoman at the Spanish government delegates office in Melilla said that if Morocco does not agree to the new condition of reciprocity the borders will remain closed There are suspicions that Morocco may use the pandemic to put in place a plan that seeks to end once for all the atypical trade between the two Spanish enclaves and Morocco In a written parliamentary response in June to a question asked in February Moroccos economy minister Mohamed Benchaaboun said the government intended to end merchandise smuggling activities which pose a danger to the health of citizens Rabat has already said it wishes to turn the border into a gateway for travellers only For those whose livelihoods depend on trade across the Melilla border there is now great uncertainty and the terrible prospect of further unemployment and poverty Hurria Undocumented single mother Hurria who is years old lives with her daughter in Melilla After being forced to get married at the age of she escaped her home town in Morocco only to find herself in prostitution She struggled for years in the streets of Tangier and Tetouan in Morocco Although the introduction of a new family law called Moudawana raised the minimum age for marriage the number of girls forced to get married in Morocco is still very high Moroccan courts approved more than child marriage requests in I was under enforced confinement and seriously sexually abused she recalls At the age of she escaped captivity and travelled to Melilla Since then she has been living in the city without any documents When the border was still open Hurria used to work there every day preparing food or helping elderly men and women to carry their heavy packages to the other side My daughter is only six she needs clothes and books for her school I dont want her to miss out on anything she says The money she used to earn daily paid her rent but since the lockdown forced her to stay at home she has no income I used to call one of my neighbours to help me with food and other little things but its very difficult to survive without any income she said over the phone since our meeting in Melilla

Amy Kazmin and Jyotsna Singh Wörter Juli      Vipul Mishras life has been upended Days into Indias coronavirus lockdown the software engineer was made redundant from a travel website based near New Delhi Unable to pay his rent Mishra now plans to return with his wife and baby to his hometown of Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh But neither Mishras hardships nor the recent deaths of Indian soldiers in a border clash with China has eroded his confidence in the leadership of Narendra Modi Modi is fearless he is not greedy and he doesnt work for personal gain he said of the Indian prime minister He has his ear to the ground He knows and understands people India cannot have a better prime minister Such faith runs deep Indias lockdown imposed with just four hours notice battered an already struggling economy triggered a humanitarian crisis and failed to stop the deadly pathogen from spreading rapidly India now has the worlds thirdhighest coronavirus burden after the US and Brazil with more than confirmed cases Approval ratings Yet Modis popularity remains undiminished According to Morning Consult a USbased pollster per cent of Indians approved of Modis leadership as of June far higher than any other leading democratic world leader By comparison approval ratings for UK prime minister Boris Johnson have slipped cent to per cent while US president Donald Trumps numbers languish at per cent Analysts say Indians unshakeable confidence in Modi reflects his almost messianic image as a leader who is seen as eschewing family and personal enrichment to devote himself to public service They add that he has benefited from an ineffectual opposition led by Congresss Sonia Gandhi and her son Rahul and the deference of financially vulnerable media outlets whose dependence on government advertising revenues tempers critical coverage In a febrile climate of nationalistic fervour Modis disruptive policy measures such as his cash ban and the coronavirus lockdown have been applauded as evidence of his resolve to tackle national problems In this cult of national worship Modi is seen as the national messiah who will take us back to national greatness says Asim Ali of the Centre for Policy Research a New Delhibased thinktank The media has also tried to paint Modi in a good light and cover up the fallout of the bad decisions And there is a population willing to believe it Gilles Vernier a political science professor at Ashoka University said Modis ability to inspire an almost religious fervour among his supporters had freed him from conventional accountability models so the impact of his policies mattered little Actual consequences People believe the prime minister means well They trust him to take strong and courageous decisions and they dont hold him responsible for the actual consequences said Prof Verniers Modis Bharatiya Janata party with its vast and sophisticated social media army has also proved adept at deflecting blame Indias failures have been pinned on state governments and Indians themselves especially the marginalised Muslim minority after Islamic proselytisers were found to be spreading the virus early in the lockdown From the very beginning the position was to transfer the onus of responsibility for the transmission of the disease to peoples behaviour said Prof Verniers Since the deadly border clash with Chinese troops in the Himalayas last month the BJP has tried to shift public focus towards the previous Congress party governments relations with Beijing Modi has also sought to keep himself above the fray of political debate In his six years as prime minister he has not granted any unscripted interviews or held a single press conference After last years election delivered a thumping new majority he spent a day meditating in a remote Himalayan cave a move that helped reinforce his image as a semidivine Hindu holy man He went to the cave to project himself as Lord Shiva incarnate said a political pollster who requested anonymity Every demagogue convinces the masses that he is God Almighty himself In north India it was common to hear people say Modi has come to dispel the forces of evil and darkness and inject light into India Erratic policymaking But the pandemic and border crisis have cast shadows over Modis determined mythmaking Some in the business community have expressed their exasperation with erratic policymaking poor planning and the absence of a strategic vision Rajiv Bajaj managing director of Bajaj Auto one of the countrys biggest motorcycle manufacturers says Indias lockdown has flattened the wrong curve its not the infection curve its the GDP curve in an online video discussion with Rahul Gandhi Many vulnerable migrants left stranded for months without work incomes or transport home have also felt angry and abandoned Modi has no idea how the poor of this country are suffering says Arun Kumar a Delhibased day labourer who struggled for weeks to get home to his village in Himachal Pradesh after the lockdown left him with no income Whether the poor lives or dies he does not care He just wants to show off his power Yet Modis political position appears unassailable given the lack of any

295,../data/sec_IRL/Irish Times/Factiva-20230807-165,Opinion Trump in deep trouble days before the polls open The danger for the president is that he is running the election campaign using the playbook Suzanne Lynch Wörter Juli      In an interview with Donald Trump last weekend TV host Chris Wallace posed a question that is preoccupying many Americans Can you give a direct answer that you will accept the election I have to see replied Trump I have to see No Im not going to just say yes Im not going to say no and I didnt last time either Trumps refusal to commit to accepting Novembers election results is seen as the latest evidence of a leader drifting towards authoritarianism The concept of a peaceful transition of power is one of the basic tenets of democracy Already Trump has been laying the ground for disputing the election result by questioning the reliability of postal voting Mailin Voting unless changed by the courts will lead to the most CORRUPT ELECTION in our Nations History he tweeted this week adding RIGGEDELECTION But Trumps brazen suggestion that he may delegitimise the election results come November is a mark of insecurity and weakness As America passes the mark before election day tomorrow Trump appears to be in deep trouble Polling over the last month shows Joe Biden the presumptive Democratic nominee well ahead of the incumbent nationally and in the key battleground states that swung the election for Trump last time around He has opened up a doubledigit lead in an average of polls over the last month Trump has remained defiant The polls were fake in and now theyre even more fake he has declared While his scepticism of polling is understandable given his unexpected victory over Hillary Clinton in Bidens lead is much greater than Clintons was at this stage of the campaign Even in swing states where Bidens lead is tighter than the picture nationally he is still comfortably ahead of Clintons polling margins Despite his public bravado a series of Uturns in the last week suggests that privately Trump is worried The president has replaced his campaign manager Brad Parscale who was blamed for last months disastrous rally in Tulsa when Trump faced rows of empty seats Trump has also made several pivots on the coronavirus pandemic a topic that has become the defining issue ahead of the election Disastrous This week he was forced to cancel next months Republican National Convention in Jacksonville Florida amid a surge in coronavirus cases After deriding advice to use face masks for months he has now urged Americans to don facecoverings Similarly he resumed daily coronavirus briefings at the White House having abandoned the concept after a disastrous April press conference when he suggested ingesting bleach to guard against the virus Reading from a preprepared script this week he struck a more contrite and less combative tone as he warned that the virus would get worse before it will get better though he still insisted that America has done better than most countries Amid criticism that his campaign lacks any firm policy proposals Trump has also gone on the offensive in a bid to elevate law and order to the centre of American political debate presumably to deflect from coronavirus Trump ordered federal forces to Portland Oregon where nightly protests have been taking place since the death of George Floyd in May at the hands of Minneapolis police officers He followed up by deploying more agents to Chicago this week citing a recent spike in gun crime in the city against the wishes of the citys AfricanAmerican Democrat mayor Lori Lightfoot The sight of armed military agents patrolling Americas streets has alarmed those concerned about the state of American democracy while giving Trump the perfect visual backdrop for his selfportrayal as a president who is tough on crime This narrative is being supported by Fox  which is running dramatic coverage of the protests that have resulted in no deaths while a pandemic that has killed more than Americans plays second fiddle in their news coverage Will these recent shifts in strategy work The danger for Trump is that he is running the election campaign using the playbook His characterisation of protesters as radical lefts and anarchists is a rewrite of his demonisation of Mexican and Muslim immigrants four years ago This time the enemy without has become the enemy within as Trump gambles on pitting Americans against Americans While Trump is betting that his instinctual ability to tap into the fears and anxieties of conservative Americans will see him through the dynamics of this election cycle are different While Trump is likely correct in thinking that his core base of supporters perhaps a solid per cent of the national vote will stick with him his forfeiture of the middle ground is risky Firstly polls show that there were many more undecided voters in who ultimately broke for Trump willing to give the political outsider a chance This time they are casting their votes after Trump has had four years to prove himself but has achieved very little Biden is also a more popular choice than Clinton in some swing states such as Wisconsin and Pennsylvania even if his main attraction to voters is the fact that he is not Trump Challenges Data from the primary cycle this year also suggests worrying trends for Republicans Following the surge in voter registration and turnout that saw Democrats win the House of Representatives in the midterm elections of this years presidential primary elections also saw high turnout despite the challenges of voting in a pandemic and technical difficulties around postal voting There is still time for Trump to turn the election around The coronavirus pandemic may well be under control by the autumn and Biden has yet to be tested electorally But days out from the election things need to change dramatically for Trump if he is to become a secondterm president Suzanne

300,../data/sec_IRL/Irish Times/Factiva-20230807-165,Weekend THE ROSE WHO BECAME A MEDIA MOGUL Belfastborn Sinead Boucher bought the Stuff group for one dollar during the pandemic Amy OConnor Wörter August      Back in May Belfastborn Sinead Boucher made headlines when she purchased New Zealand media group Stuff from its Australian owners for the symbolic sum of In doing so Boucher became the sole owner of the media group and helped rescue it from an uncertain fate Stuff operates the most popular news website in New Zealand and also owns print titles including a number of national newspapers local newspapers and magazines The company also owns Neighbourly a hyperlocal social platform which aims to connect neighbours Bouchers takeover has been well received and was even described by one New Zealand commentator as a gutsy bighearted and highly risky play So how did a Belfast girl ascend the ranks to become one of the most respected and influential figures in New Zealand media Boucher was born in Belfast in When she was three years old her parents Seán and Mary OHanlon decided to move the family to Christchurch They were an ordinary workingclass family she says Her father worked as a glazier while her mother worked a variety of jobs She recalls making one trip to Ireland as a youngster but otherwise the family stayed put in New Zealand Boucher now holds dual citizenship having become a citizen of New Zealand three years ago After school Boucher decided to study law at Canterbury university It wasnt for her and she dropped out to take a year off and travel Around this time she entered the local Rose of Tralee competition and was selected to be the New Zealand Rose She travelled to Ireland to represent her adopted homeland in the competition Nearly years on she describes the experience as huge fun It was a really nice thing to do to come over from here and do that I didnt really have any idea what a big deal it was down there The girl who won was from Cork she recalls She did this thing where she whipped off her skirt and she was in her Irish dancing dress and performed a great dance That was lots of fun With the Rose of Tralee having covered the cost of her plane ticket to Ireland she decided to spend a year in Belfast She lived with her aunt and spent her time getting to know her extended family and becoming reacquainted with the city she left as a small child While there she got a job working in the purchasing department of the Europa Hotel through the local job centre After the hotel was targeted in a bomb attack Boucher ended up leaving to work in a local newspaper selling classified ads It was her first foray into the world of media I was so useless she laughs I sold no ads at all I dont think even one I definitely proved I had more talent on the editorial side of the business than the commercial side Upon returning to New Zealand she enrolled in a sixmonth course in journalism school She spent several years working as a rookie reporter with Christchurch paper The Press before moving to London with her now husband Mark There she worked as a digital reporter with FTcom and as a news correspondent with Reuters After welcoming a daughter in the couple decided to relocate back to New Zealand where they live in Wellington with their two children Back on home turf she landed a gig as assistant editor with The Press In she was appointed group digital editor tasked with overseeing the development of stuffconz then a fledgling online news outlet Following a stint as group executive editor she was appointed chief executive of Stuff in In Stuffs parent company Fairfax Media merged with Nine Entertainment an Australian media company It quickly became apparent that Nine Entertainment had little interest in holding on to Stuff Bottom of the box They didnt want to own a New Zealand business explains Boucher We were the strange thing at the bottom of the box of things you buy at auction Due to competition laws in New Zealand the new owners encountered trouble finding a quick and easy sale NZME one of New Zealands top media companies and one of Stuffs main rivals launched a takeover bid but it failed to progress There was a lot of concern about the level of control it would give one company over the media says Boucher One night earlier this year Bouchers boss in Nine Entertainment called her and told her the deal with NZME wasnt going anywhere The company wanted to exit the New Zealand market by the end of May and were looking at potentially winding Stuff up if a buyer could not be found I got off the call and I felt so gutted about the fact that they were prepared to walk away from some of those titles she says noting that some of the newspapers in the stable are more than years old After speaking with her husband and Ramesh Vedachalam the chief financial officer of Stuff she decided to put in an offer for Stuff I rang him her boss back and said Rather than close down the company would you sell it to me for You can walk away and we can keep going And he said Yes What followed was two intense weeks of negotiations conducted remotely from her kitchen table Even though the price was a dollar there was a lot of detail to go through she says Eventually in late May she submitted an electronic signature and the deal was done It got signed at midnight she says I was sitting at the kitchen table and everyone else had gone to bed The house was dark Celebrations that night were subdued She told her family the news on Zoom and they were gobsmacked Afterwards she went over to her friends house in sweatpants and slippers for a celebratory drink Happily the news was warmly welcomed by staff I had people come over and just stand looking at me with tears running down their face she says It was a reflection of the anxiety and uncertainty that had gone on It was incredible A few weeks later Boucher went to a lawyers office and officially handed over for the company Because we were still doing social distancing I had to throw my dollar to the lawyer she laughs She dropped it the first time so I had to pick it up and throw it again Then I gave her another dollar out of my pocket because I wanted to keep that one I have it in a little frame now Boucher takes over Stuff at what is an undeniably challenging time for the media The coronavirus pandemic has been devastating for many outlets including Stuff which experienced an per cent dip in advertising in the initial stages of the crisis However she says that the pandemic has also led to a surge in traffic as well as newspaper subscriptions and voluntary contributions People have been reminded of the need for quality journalism and credible news While weve all been more challenged as businesses it has reminded us what the purpose of our work is she says It gives us an opportunity to build on that build up public trust and ultimately encourage people to want to pay for journalism and contribute to a healthy and corruptionfree democracy In recent weeks Stuff has garnered international attention over its decision to stop publishing articles and videos on Facebook The group had previously stopped advertising on Facebook due to the social networks underwhelming response to the Christchurch mosque shootings in which Muslim worshippers were murdered by a single gunman The attack was livestreamed on Facebook We withdrew our advertising then because we didnt think it was right to fund a platform that enabled those things to happen she says That decision had zero impact on the business and they started discussing the idea of withdrawing from the platform entirely Facebook was quickly becoming a morass of misinformation and hate speech and they no longer wanted to participate in it With that in mind they stopped posting content to Facebook on July on a trial basis So far they havent seen much of an impact What we have seen in the four weeks or so is that our audience has dropped very marginally she says Our page impressions have hardly had a dent in them at all Conspiracies Some in the industry have argued that news should be shared on Facebook to counteract the widely shared hoaxes and conspiracies that bounce around the platform Boucher doesnt agree Why should we fund the creation of good work with a view to putting it on a platform that wont take responsibility for its own mess she says People can freely access our news Its not paywalled Things are brighter than when Boucher first took over Stuff all those months ago New Zealand has all but eliminated the virus and successfully emerged from lockdown Advertising has picked up and is now at per cent of what it was prior to the pandemic Public trust and goodwill is high Nonetheless people are cautious Theres a sense that everything has gone back to normal but at any point there could be some breach of the quarantine or another outbreak and what would happen then she says Bouchers goal for now is to ensure that Stuff can withstand future shocks to the system We own the business were preparing our strategies and all the things we want to do But were also preparing our business to be strong enough to survive another lockdown and build up reserves of cash to carry us through It might be gutsy and risky but the Belfast native wouldnt have it any other way

southeastern Alabama backing up a previous tweet to leaving the Paris climate accord the attacks have been relentless And while the Sharpiegate incident garnered many headlines deeper and more devastating incisions have been made into the scientific and research worlds The current Trumpappointed administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA Andrew Wheeler is a former lobbyist for the coal industry Funding for studies into the effects of chemicals on pregnant women has ceased according to a New York Times report from December An expert committee investigating the impact of invasive insects has ended and been disbanded Relaxing regulations surrounding the EPA fossil fuels and climate change initiatives are primary White House targets say experts A lot of protections were put into place to regulate offshore drilling after the Deepwater Horizon explosion says Desikan of the British Petroleum disaster that cost lives and spilt nearly five million barrels of oil into the waters of the Gulf of Mexico Those protections have been eroded every single way you can think of under the Trump Administration Inspections A study published in Geophysical Research Letters found that the resultant fire saw between and million pounds of black carbon released into the atmosphere over a nineweek period highlighting the added damage the disaster wrought on affecting climatic temperatures In May president Trumps interior department moved to ease inspection and safety requirements for offshore drilling projects previously put in place by the Obama administration A study into how inspections of offshore drilling could be made safer was nixed by the White House in December Whats more findings from a freedom of information request by Politico showed that the interior department had granted waivers to offshore safety requirements the most common being those sidestepping requirements around blowout preventers Then theres the White Houses mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic a folly a number of polls suggest could see Trump booted out of office in November Disregard for science is evident in many policies and behaviours of the current administration but the worst is the presidents assertions about what is true based on his belief system says Prof Jo Handelsman director of the Wisconsin Institute for Discovery at the University of WisconsinMadison who worked in the Obama administration as the associate director for science at the White House I have spent my career teaching people about the principles of scientific inquiry which is based on hypotheses that are tested by rigorous experimentation and data analysis Modelling the use of belief systems as equivalent with scientific data is damaging to the process of building a society that is built on evidence If citizens cannot evaluate information and build logical arguments then democracy crumbles Handelsman believes The president has repeatedly undermined his own experts and claimed the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine to be a cure for despite a host of administration experts and research work claiming it has no beneficial effect Following the presidents assertions hundreds of thousands of prescriptions have been issued across the country It might come as a surprise to some but in sharp contrast to their contemporary cohort many of Americas most important scientific and environmental efforts came off the desks of Republican presidents Teddy Roosevelt pushed for a national system of parks and monuments that gave birth to the National Parks System in while Richard Nixons administration established the EPA in But whats behind Mr Trumps anti science stance Some argue the fallout of the financial crisis dealt a defining blow to the environmental movement among rural American voters the same families employed in mining and other industrial activities and who for decades voted Democrat found themselves caught between a growing standardisation of environmental protections and controls and their own livelihoods With poor and rural Americans suffering more than most in the years that followed and with little prospect of their jobs coming back or being replaced the environment became a divisive and politicised issue Its exactly among this stratum of American society as well of course as elements of the religious right thats inherently suspicious of the role of science in everyday life whom Donald Trump relies on for a large swathe of his support Still some have not given up hope entirely The Trump administration continues to announce funding for efforts to preserve historical sites Oftentimes and despite the White Houses stance bipartisan political leaders have stepped in to push through funding for science and scientificrelated laws In July Congress passed the landmark Great American Outdoors Act that commits up to billion € billion in backdated and other funding for the National Parks and other conservation systems for the next five years in addition to million € million a year to the Land and Water Conservation Fund a federal programme As soon as October the National Park Service can use these funds to begin restoring our parks protecting landscapes and generating muchneeded jobs says Marcia Argust project director of the Pew Charitable Trusts Restore Americas Parks campaign Trump signed the Act into law on August Information Furthermore the pandemic presents a host of opportunities for scientific advancement and discovery say experts Jo Handelsman believes that if the public rhetoric around science can be reframed to set it squarely as a force for good there is a teachable moment created by She adds that with the right leadership the US could build on the stream of scientific information the pandemic has fuelled The factions who revere science are still here we just need to provide the centre stage to science rather than fabrications Handelsman says Its these factions that see the US firmly positioned as the worlds scientific dynamo now and into the future Ive seen the power and beauty of the American government from the inside and I lived through eight years that brought some of the best out of this country that Ive seen in my lifetime so Im still an optimist

305,../data/sec_IRL/Irish Times/Factiva-20230807-165,Opinion Why the EU is going cold on China Ruadhán Mac Cormaic Wörter September      It was as the politburo might put it a charm offensive with Chinese characteristics The fivecountry trip to Europe by Chinas foreign minister Wang Yi his first foreign travel since February was ostensibly a routine tour to strengthen relations between Beijing and key European capitals but coming at a time of such acute tension between China and the United States it was very clearly designed to preempt any signs of a joint EUUS front against Beijing On each stop Wang warned pointedly of the dangers of a new Cold War between east and west But while mending fraying relationships was the objective the travels of Chinas chief diplomat merely underlined how EUChina relations have deteriorated in just a few months In Berlin Wang threatened Czech senate speaker Milos Vystrcil for his recent visit to Taiwan saying Vystrcil would pay a heavy price for his shortsighted behaviour That earned Wang a rebuke from Heiko Mass Germanys foreign minister who at a joint press conference said that in the European Union we deal with our international partners together and with respect and threats do not fit into that approach Germany is Chinas biggest trading partner and under Angela Merkel has been slow to criticise it in public The same is true of Italy which under its previous government developed a close relationship with Beijing and is the only EU state to sign up to Chinas Belt and Road Initiative of international economic development Publicly chastised In Rome last week however Wang was publicly chastised by his Italian counterpart Luigi di Maio over Beijings crackdown in Hong Kong In Paris President Emmanuel Macron took the opportunity to upbraid his Chinese visitor over the situation in Hong Kong and human rights abuses perpetrated against the Muslim Uighur population in Xinjiang No sooner had Wang left France than Macron gave a speech in which he said he would prefer to see European telecoms firms build mobile networks than Chinas Huawei The absent cities on Wangs itinerary told their own story There was no visit to London which has issued a de facto albeit future ban on the use of Huawei and has put up a strong defence of democracy activists in Hong Kong Nor did the delegation visit Brussels where the European Commission has begun openly to refer to the EUs rivalry with China At least some of the cooling in relations between Europe and China is linked to the pandemic Many EU capitals believe Beijing was too slow to share information about the deadly new coronavirus that emerged in China late last year When the virus reached Europe and China made widelypublicised deliveries of medical equipment the EU resented what it saw as Beijings attempt to politicise emergency aid the EU had earlier offered extensive support to China in its fight to contain but without insisting that the world know all about it EU officials complained At the same time public opinion was turning Drawing on polling across nine EU states the European Council on Foreign Relations in July reported that peoples attitudes towards China had cooled markedly since the pandemic struck The EU has tried to avoid taking sides in the dispute between China and the Trump administration It is as unlikely to join in Trumps belligerent posturing as it is to submit to the authoritarian regime in Beijing Chinas fears that Trump could drive a wedge between it and Europe are probably overdone But the EU has itself been growing more realistic and assertive in its approach to China in recent years as foreign policy chief Josep Borrell wrote in this newspaper in May Unfair obstacles Talks on a new investment treaty have stalled over what the Europeans see as unfair obstacles facing their companies in China A litany of European grievances over a lack of reciprocity in trade and economic relations have come to a head at a time when Chinese human rights abuses in Xinjiang in particular have dominated the headlines In July the EU imposed sanctions on China over its treatment of Hong Kong and in May the blocs diplomatic arm accused China of running a global disinformation campaign to deflect blame for the pandemic and improve its international image When EU and Chinese leaders met for a virtual summit in May they couldnt even agree a joint communiqué A major summit between Xi Jinping Merkel and other EU leaders due to take place later this month has been downgraded For decades the EU thought of China chiefly as an economic actor a trading partnerbut a clean separation between political economic and strategic interests is no longer tenable So the bloc needs a strategic framework that joins them together Its hardly a secret that both the EU and China hope that in Novembers US election Trump will be unseated by Joe Biden who served as vicepresident in an administration whose general attitude towards China was not dissimilar to the EUs today But for the EU hoping for a return to the status quo ante in Washington this winter does not amount to a China policy 
306,../data/sec_IRL/Irish Times/Factiva-20230807-165,Weekend THE FAR RIGHTRISES Still a fragmented minority movement in Ireland the farright is using the Covid crisis to extend its influence onlineand on the street Conor Gallagher Wörter September      Shortly after last Saturday messaging accounts belonging to Irelands most active farright activists began to light up with glee Ever see a lesbian bleed before a poster named Irelands Woes asked their subscribers The left must have a fetish for getting beaten up said another poster calling themselves Edgy memes na hÉireann Their joy on Saturday was caused by an assault on a veteran LGBT campaigner who goes by the name Izzy Kamikaze who had been attacked while counterprotesting an antiface mask rally outside Leinster House Kamikaze was hit by a piece of wood wrapped in a tricolour leaving her with a nasty head wound that required hospital treatment The words of the posters are almost as ugly as the attack itself The people who wrote them are part of what experts and gardaí believe is a growing farright movement in Ireland one that is attempting to hijack social concerns in a bid for the mainstream support Until recently these movements existed almost entirely online often in the shadier corners of the internet But issues such as direct provision child protection and more recently opposition to measures have brought the far right onto the streets Violence has sometimes followed close behind The messages above and others like them were posted on Telegram a platform popular among the Irish far right due in part to its almost complete lack of moderation Telegram has a much lower profile than mainstream social sites and allows users complete anonymity Hidden by this cloak they are often very forthright in their views AntiSemitism neoNazism and the promotion of violence against minorities positions that can result in users being banned from Facebook and Twitter are celebrated in many of the Telegram communities It is also a forum where activists plan ways of getting their message out to what they call the normies ie the general public These schemes include organising users to flood social media with racist comments about an RTÉ show about black Irish people and placing antiSemitic stickers on Dublin lampposts at night The masked man who hit Kamikaze at Leinster House was part of a group of protesters wearing badges that read Antifa Hunting Permit Open Season All Genders Antifa short for AntiFascist is a leftwing decentralised protest movement which has gained prominence in the US in recent years for aggressively and sometimes violently protesting against the far right The attack on Kamikaze was the second violent incident involving farright activists in a month On August a group of men wearing face masks and surgical gloves and armed with a variety of weapons clashed with counterprotesters at a much bigger antimask demonstration at Dublins Customs House Some of the group which made up a tiny minority of those attending the event would later claim they were protecting demonstrators from Antifa With similar demonstrations and marches planned over the next several weekends gardaí fear the violence could escalate It is not clear how lockdown measures might affect this activity Back on Telegram the glee over Kamikazes injury soon turned to suspicion that she had faked it to make farright activists look bad Several posters asserted she had employed some sort of blood pack for added realism Users were instructed to spread this theory on social media Gardaí have been concerned about the burgeoning far right in Ireland for some time Some years ago a small unit was tasked with monitoring their online content but only last year were these fears voiced publicly I am concerned about rightwing extremism We can see evidence of it on our shores as we have seen it spread across Europe Commissioner Drew Harris said in November In June Europol also warned of a marked increase in farright activity in Ireland adding that known criminal elements have been identified as affiliated with rightwing protests According to Garda sources this referred to former dissident republicans drug dealers and burglars Several of the men involved in the violence at the Customs House in August were once members of the now apparently defunct Irish branch of Generation Identity and according to security sources are believed to have attended combat and survival training courses abroad with the group l l l What is the far right The term can be a clumsy and vague label Some on the left apply it to anyone to the right of the mainstream political parties Some conservatives see the term far right as a way of denigrating mainstream conservative views such as strong immigration controls and opposition to abortion But if the term is taken to mean groups with extreme views such as belief in the antiSemitic great replacement conspiracy theory or who have established links to European neoNazi or fascist groups then there is little doubt the movement has grown in recent years according to the Garda and monitoring groups Certainly in the last year there has been proliferation of groups and there has been growth in the likes and shares they are getting on social media says Shane OCurry of the European Network against Racism Ireland Enar Enar received reports of racist incidents in an increase of on figures And according to Dr Eileen Culloty a disinformation researcher at DCU farright activity has accelerated since the start of the pandemic Back in March they were mostly scapegoating minorities for breaking the lockdown rules even though minorities are making up a large proportion of the key workers keeping Europe open Then over the summer it moved towards exploiting peoples frustration over the restrictions and claiming Covid was a hoax And then in the last month or so it has culminated in these antimask demonstrations that are popping up around Europe Involvement of the far right in European antimask protests is most evident in Germany where on August a group of activists that included far right members tried to storm the German parliament after a demonstration Farright groups have been active participants in antilockdown protests in Dublin including one in August and two separate events last weekend Philip Dwyer a National Party candidate who received votes in the last general election boasted about providing security at the Customs House protest in August Party members also unfurled a banner at the event reading Ireland belongs to the Irish The National Party which was founded in describes itself as Irish nationalist party dedicated to the fulfilment of the Irish national idea Its leader Justin Barrett has called for the deportation of nonethnic Irish people such as Dublin Lord Mayor Hazel Chu and has said his party is for straight Irish people only The organisers of the August protest Health Freedom Ireland HFI says it is a nonpolitical group and that all are welcome at its events HFI bills itself as a group which actively supports medical freedom of its citizens We ask that all people in this country that share some or all of our concerns set aside any other differences they may have and unite for the common concerns that we all have in a peaceful manner founder Maeve Murran told  She says it is not in contact with Dwyer or the National Party We cannot control who is going to show up and who might share our views on this topic she says We are protesting for a very specific reason and we dont expect every participant to agree with us on everything else also The far right was also present at a similar protest last Saturday led by the Yellow Vests a populist protest movement set up to emulate the French Gilets Jaunes It has protested on a broad range of issues in recent years including vulture funds property taxes and the banking system It is also a vocal critic of the immigration system Its march on Saturday was led by a formal colour party made up of members of a Donegalbased farright group called Siol na hÉireann The groups founder Niall McConnell describes it as a hard line Irish Catholic Nationalist Party In fact Siol na hÉireann is a registered company McConnell stood in the last general election as an independent and received votes McConnell was also one of the speakers at the Yellow Vest protest where he railed against LGBT propaganda and equated immigration to a plantation Yellow Vest leaders later spoke out against McConnells speech and said all were welcome at their protests Neither the Yellow Vests nor McConnell responded to queries about his role in the march The Donegal man who is a sheep farmer by trade regularly hosts members of European fascist parties such as the German NDP and the Romanian Noua Dreapta on his YouTube channel Last month he and his followers attracted headlines when they confronted a priest in Ballyhaunis who had allowed two members of the Muslim community to give a blessing at Mass In a video uploaded online the group accused Fr Stephen Farragher of being a heretic and of bringing foreign satanic cultists into the Church l l l The far right is made up a tiny minority of the attendees at the Yellow Vest and HFIled protests Culloty says it is important to realise that people attending these protests are from a broad range of backgrounds Some believe in conspiracy theories about the virus but have no problem with immigration Others probably the majority simply think the Government restrictions have gone too far Initially the crowd at Saturdays demonstration cheered McConnell when he lambasted the Government and EU but were noticeably silent when he moved onto immigration and LGBT criticism One of the speakers at the HFI protest in August was Dr Marcus de Brun a Rush GP who has been a vocal critic of the Government restrictions I would consider myself liberal leftleaning in my political outlook he tells  adding that he shares concerns about farright elements inserting themselves into the antirestrictions movement I would have nothing to do with the Irish Freedom Party whose leaders also spoke at the protest or the National Party The Irish Freedom Party was launched in to campaign for Irish withdrawal from the EU Its leader Hermann Kelly has advocated for a monocultural Irish society and been a proponent of the great replacement a conspiracy theory stating western governments are intentionally replacing their native populations with immigrants At least some of the blame for the growth of the far right says de Brun lies with the media including  and the mainstream establishment which is afraid of going against the narrative on So youre really left with this vacuum that got filled up very very quickly by the same people who object to everything in order to try and get a foothold on public platforms l l l Opposition to measures is merely the latest cause hijacked by the far right says Mark Malone a member the Farright Observatory an informal network of antiracism activists which monitors the Irish far right They like to jump on bandwagons For some of them its cash motivated the bigger their audience the more money comes in from YouTube views and merchandise sales For others its about building up an infrastructure and growing it Last year activists focused on the opening of direct provision centres in rural Ireland often travelling to prospective host towns and spreading disinformation about the asylum system Their advice was often rejected by locals In July the Irish Freedom Party the National Party and an activist called Michael OKeeffe who often goes by the online pseudonym Chopper helped organise a rally outside the Dáil demanding the resignation of Minister for Children Roderic OGorman who they accused of being sympathetic to paedophiles OGorman faced weeks of abuse before and after the event because of a photograph of him at a Pride March alongside UK LGBT campaign Peter Tatchell who in wrote a controversial letter to the Guardian newspaper concerning sex between adults and children By their own measures the event was a success for the far right About people stood and listened to an address by Barrett the National Party leader who has previously spoken at neoNazi rallies in Europe Some of the crowd held up placards depicting a noose The event was also addressed by actor John Connors he later said he regretted attending and apologised to OGorman The accusations are rooted in homophobia stoked by anonymous farright Twitter accounts OGorman said later These accounts are using manipulation for their own ends playing upon the genuine deeply held concern we all share for child protection The far right both here and abroad has developed an obsession with paedophilia videos regularly show activists accusing counterprotesters of being paedoscum or some variation thereof According to Aoife Gallagher an analyst with the Institute for Strategic Dialogue ISD a counterextremism organisation much of this comes from the QAnon conspiracy theory popular with the US far right QAnon is shorthand for an array of fantastical theories including a belief that the highest levels of government has been taken over by paedophiles Gallagher says Irish farright groups believe OGorman is a perfect target … given that he is an openly gay man and Minister for Children she says The far right have been linking paedophilia to homosexuality for decades mostly down to a complete ignorance about LGBTQ lives and lifestyles l l l Farright activists achieved another breakthrough of sorts this year when they sought to shape the narrative around an attack on a white teenager by a black assailant The endeavour spearheaded by OKeeffe focused on portraying the incident as a racial attack despite gardaí saying there appeared to be a different motive Patriot Analytica are about to break the internet OKeeffe announced on Twitter a reference to his loose collective of farright activists Over on an online discussion board infamous for its unrestrained racism an anonymous user implored readers to take to social media and fight back against the narrative that the incident was not racially motivated Readers were asked to reply to all the lefties and drown them out … Take control of the narrative now The call to arms was successful The thread attracted some replies of them mentioning the offensive word nr It is a wellworn strategy according to Ross Frenett the founder of Moonshot CVE a Londonbased technology company that studies online violent extremism Online activists spot reports of crime involving a black or Muslim perpetrator The incident will then be artificially amplified with the aim of having a prominent rightwing personality such as Katie Hopkins or even one of the Trump family pick up it and make it go mainstream Data gathered by Moonshot showed only per cent of the tweets about the assault came from Irish accounts Eighteen per cent came from the US While these individual farright groups in Ireland seem very small they are part of a bigger international network of farright extremists across Europe and the US where they are emboldened by leaders like Donald Trump or Victor Orban in Hungary They learn from each other and feed off each other says Culloty They are able to mobilise social media campaigns to turn some relatively small event involving migrants and crime and then that gets amplified around the world by this international group Speaking to  in June OKeeffe denied being part of the aspect of the operation has a mind of its own and they like to take credit for things they havent done he said Asked what Patriot Analytica is he said it is a group of people all over the island who cover the stories your employer refuses to l l l The future prospects of the Irish far right remain unclear Despite appearances mistrust and jealousy means the far right remains a fragmented movement here says Gallagher the analyst from ISD A lot of the different groups are very very fractured and they dont seem to be able to get along that well A case in point is McConnell who has been shunned by much of the far right in the last week One of the reasons for this is his address to Saturdays antimask rally According to Telegram users McConnell was too upfront with his views on immigration and LGBT people in the presence of the general public a cardinal sin for farright activists He is the biggest threat to Irish nationalism right now fretted one Telegram user shortly afterwards Others believe he is only out to make money through donation appeals and selling Michael Collins Tshirts For his part McConnell has said he is suing members of the National Party He is currently seeking donations for his legal fund Also shunned by many activists is Gemma ODoherty a former journalist who until recently at least was one of the most prominent figures in the far right movement The Dublin woman has regularly uploaded videos railing against LGBT people Muslims and immigrants as well as conspiracy theories alleging the Jewish philanthropist George Soros was behind a plan to flood Ireland with immigrants ODoherty told her followers recently she was not welcome at Julys Roderic OGorman protest Also against the movement is the fact that after much criticism social media companies are beginning to wake up to the problem here YouTube which is owned by Google has long been accused of allowing people to become radicalised by extremist content through its video recommendation algorithms In response it overhauled its algorithm and updated its hatespeech policy leading to a fivefold increase in the number of channels being removed Our policies are consistently changing and evolving just as societies change and evolve a spokeswoman said Monitoring at Twitters Dublin offices has improved in recent months leading to farright accounts being removed with greater frequency This includes the account of ODoherty who was removed from the platform in July having been banned from YouTube and Facebook in This has had serious knockon effects on ODohertys ability to spread her message In recent months her personal website has fallen about places in the global rankings The far rights electoral prospects appear similarly grim though not all would agree Some candidates competed in the most recent general election on a farright platform None polled high enough to even get their expenses back But there is cause for concern says DCU political scientist Dr Eoin OMalley The growing opposition to Covid restrictions combined with a lack of other antiestablishment parties now that Sinn Féin has gone mainstream mean there is fertile ground for growth OMalley says The conditions are as good as theyre going to get for them in Ireland There is more of a possibility of electoral success than Ive seen in a long time

Biden Suzanne Lynch Wörter Oktober      Michael Taylor is a lifelong Republican The mayor of Sterling Heights a suburb in northern Detroit has already cast his vote for Joe Biden The reason Donald Trump Hes not the type of candidate that Im used to voting for as a Republican he says of the US president Hes totally out of the mainstream Hes somebody I dont trust who is harmful to our democratic institutions This goes beyond policy issues the question is is this a decent human being somebody I can trust to share my values and the values the United States has held dear for more than years The committed Republican who has been in his mayoral role since late says he voted for Trump in but regrets it I did it because thats what Republicans do Republicans vote for Republicans At the time I thought he was a really distasteful person but there were also a number of qualities in Hillary Clinton that I didnt like I didnt like either choice so I defaulted to the candidate with whom I seemed to be more politicallyaligned He believes Biden is a better candidate one who can connect with voters in his community Hes somebody who I think that people in Macomb County can relate to Hes a guy that could have easily grown up here worked here retired here Donald Trump would not be caught dead in Macomb County unless he wanted our votes Key focus Democrats are hoping that Taylors views are held by the voters of suburban Detroit a key focus for both campaigns as the election enters its final days Trump campaigned here on Tuesday while Biden is due to visit tomorrow Michigan was one of three upper midwest states that flipped Republican in helping to elect Trump to the presidency It was also the state where Trump scored his narrowest victory clinching the state by just votes in a state of about million people Macomb County a populous mostly workingclass white suburb just north of Detroit is in particular focus Michigans thirdlargest county it represents about per cent of the states vote While most of Michigan divides politically along urbanrural lines it is in suburbs such as these where the election may be won or lost next week Though Macomb County voted for Barack Obama in and it opted for Trump in by just over votes In fact the nonpartisan Cook Political Report argued Macomb was one of three counties in the country that secured the election for Trump if the Republican candidate had not won here along with York County in Pennsylvania and Waukesha County in Wisconsin he would have lost all three states and hence the electoral college Macomb County encapsulates some of the socioeconomic changes that have gradually altered the political leanings of Americas industrial heartland For decades many of its residents worked directly or indirectly for the car industry that drove Detroits booming economy Like many cities in the US Detroit experienced a white flight with many residents leaving for the suburbs after the Today downtown Detroit and its inner ring are shadows of their former selves despite efforts at urban regeneration Michael Traugott professor emeritus in political science at the University of Michigan says that one question in this election will be if Macomb County really has become reliably Republican In for example there was the phenomenon of the Reagan Democrat defectors from the Democratic Party Since then that potential for defection has persisted in Macomb County he says He also points out that Clinton did not prioritise Michigan during her campaign I think that the consensus is pretty clear that voters didnt come out in Detroit primarily because they werent energised by the Democratic candidates Trump in contrast campaigned in Macomb County in the days before the election AfricanAmericans While Democrats are hoping that a strong turnout among AfricanAmericans in the Detroit area will help turn the state back blue support for Trump in the area is still strong Mark Forton the chairman of the Macomb County Republican Party is confident that the result is not an anomaly Wearing a Trump hat when we meet he has just been campaigning in the southern part of the county focusing on Democratleaning neighbourhoods Were going to take Macomb County big he says describing phenomenal enthusiasm at the doorsteps for Trump The only thing were worried about is fraud he says This idea about being able to count votes so many days after the election give me a break People have known about this forever if they cant get their ballot in or not vote personally on November What theyre trying to do is stuff the ballots Michael Salyers has been busy delivering Trump signs around the neighbourhood from the back of his enormous pickup truck He says that for decades this was a reliably Democratic area due in part to the power of the unions But the Democratic Party changed he says They got too radical They went too far left People said no were tired of it It was the silent majority speaking Nonetheless polls suggest that of the three RustBelt states that voted Republican in Michigan Pennsylvania and Wisconsin Biden is bestplaced to win back Michigan The Real Clear Politics average of polls has the Democratic candidate eight points ahead though Clinton was points ahead in some polls in Michigan a month before the election The results of the midterm elections also point to huge enthusiasm towards the Democratic cause particularly in the Detroit and Ann Arbor areas Three Democratic women were elected to leadership position at state levels including governor attorney general and secretary of state such as Gretchen Whitmer who won the gubernatorial race Democrats increased their share of seats in the state House of Representatives from five to seven with Rashida Tlaib becoming one of two Muslim congresswomen elected The recent uncovering of a kidnap plot against Whitmer has also injected a new dynamic into the Michigan race The state gained national attention earlier this year when Whitmer introduced stringent lockdown measures in the early wave of the pandemic prompting pushback from Republicans some of whom tried to storm the state capitol in Lansing and Trump who repeatedly denounced that woman from Michigan Elissa Slotkin who was elected to the US Congress in also said she has received anonymous threats of violence How this background of rising tensions and escalating threats plays in the election remains to be seen though it may well help motivate suburban women voters amid signs that Trump could be losing the female vote With the margins so tight in the Great Lakes state for both parties turnout will be key to political success on November 
322,../data/sec_IRL/Irish Times/Factiva-20230807-165,Ireland Trump using executive orders to reshape fabric of America Dave Hannigan Wörter Oktober      On September with an uncharacteristic lack of fanfare President Donald Trump signed executive order into law Titled Combating Race and Sex Stereotyping it was in classically Orwellian doublethink designed to do just the opposite Not that most people even noticed It didnt make any of the network news bulletins on television that night They were too concerned with the supreme court vacancy and Trumps bizarre claim he did a fine job protecting the country from coronavirus to focus on something specifically intended to copperfasten inequality of all kinds Within days however companies and institutions all over America were reacting to it They immediately cancelled all programmes supposed to promote diversity in hiring practices to improve equality of opportunity for minorities and to battle sexual and racial harassment in the workplace Those apparently can longer be tolerated Any organisation found to be using phrases such as white privilege systemic racism and unconscious bias in their training of employees would be contravening the presidents wishes and liable to lose lucrative government contracts or in the case of schools colleges and universities crucial federal funding After a summer of extraordinary social discontent yet more police shootings of unarmed black people and violent street protests that caused even corporate America to finally wake up to the need to address racial inequality this was payback time by Trump and his administration Among other things the order prevents any institution that receives public money from discussing historical events such as slavery in a way that causes an individual to feel discomfort guilt or anguish A tip line has even been established for aggrieved employees or students to report such incidents to the authorities Executive orders are not legislation do not require congressional approval and can only be overturned by a sitting president Every incumbent since George Washington has used them and Franklin D Roosevelt used one to send JapaneseAmericans to internment camps during the second World War Obamas example Barack Obama was a fan of the device especially by when it became clear that the Republicancontrolled House was going to frustrate his every attempt to legislate in the normal way Even his supporters point out his fondness for these very orders showed Trump and his handlers exactly how much could be achieved with a swoop of the pen He has issued so far this year and in total since his inauguration a strike rate far outstripping Obama Bill Clinton and the two Bushes In his first month in office back in he set the tone showcasing his determination to bypass Congress to implement controversial initiatives designed to play well in the more extreme caverns of talk radio In quick succession he used his unilateral power to ban citizens of seven Muslimmajority countries including refugees from entering the United States to try to emasculate Obamas overhaul of the healthcare system and to remove protections afforded transgender students who want to use school bathrooms corresponding to their gender identity More recent executive orders have ranged from ridiculous trying and failing to put manners on Tik Tok and ineffective an unenforceable attentiongrabbing attempt to lower the cost of prescription medicines to downright sinister Witness this months executive order On Creating Schedule F in The Excepted Service a spectacularly dull title disguising more malevolent intent Effectively it created a new category of permanent civil servant allowing those in that classification to be fired at will for releasing information or producing data contradicting the administrations policy goals Aside from controlling the message pundits interpret it as Trump giving himself power to sack troublesome truthtellers such as Dr Anthony Fauci or those in the Center for Disease Control whose scientific findings undermine his own narrative about the virus While Trump claims he just wants a way to eliminate underperforming workers he has removed all employment protection from swathes of longserving civil servants and given himself the ability to replace them with political cronies That was the reason cited by Ronald Sanders chairman of the Federal Salary Council when he tendered his resignation to the White House last Monday The executive order is nothing more than a smokescreen for what is clearly an attempt to require the political loyalty of those who advise the president said Sanders or failing that to enable their removal with little if any due process Distracted by the circus One of the fundamental issues with this presidency is that the media often get distracted by the circus act so swept up in the daily Twitter storms that they fail to notice his administration assiduously working to remake the fabric of the country While his first couple of executive orders garnered huge publicity and in the case of the travel ban and healthcare ensuing lawsuits very few people even knew about him declaring war on diversity and inclusion or introducing a type of loyalty to the leader clause in the civil service The problem is that the frequency with which he resorts to these orders can make it hard to keep up Some are diversionary such as establishing the environmentally friendly One Trillion Trees Interagency Council earlier this month while simultaneously opening up million virgin acres of Alaskas Tongass National Forest for logging Others are presumably concocted to convince him his reality show remains top of the ratings Think of the forgettable summer night at his New Jersey golf club when he signed a whopping four executive orders supposedly solving the economic problems caused by the pandemic Largely cosmetic measures they did get a hearty round of applause from the watching members in their polo shirts and shorts This past week it emerged that for his next trick Trump is considering an executive order to protect and to promote fracking with an eye to figuring out how to expand it using new technology A lot of countries have moved away from the practice due to the adverse impact on the environment and water quality but the president believes it might be enough to get him the win in Pennsylvania next Tuesday And that is ultimately all that matters

326,../data/sec_IRL/Irish Times/Factiva-20230807-165,Opinion We knew exactly who Trump was from the start Kathy Sheridan Wörter November      The most important thing to remember We knew exactly who Donald Trump was Always Four years ago he repeated that Hillary Clinton could be murdered by his second amendment pals if she won He said he would not accept the result unless he won He never changed It was those around him who dug in even if a onceina hundred years pandemic led some to finally ask questions The question for his enablers will always come back to this Were the tax cuts the regulationslashing the rightwing originalist judges worth the plunge into the Trump sewer of lawlessness nepotism and corruption On the streets of our democracy his legacy is there in the calls to a perverted patriotism and freedom the antivaxx antiimmigrant insanity the Trumpendorsed QAnon merchants the witless fake newsand constitutionally ignorant notourTaoiseach posts Can we ever go back Have the four years of the American experiment with authenticity taken us in too deep Or on the positive side have they served up fair warning and better tools The following is just a starter list of where we stand as the election results unfold today The lies The Lies In August Trump was averaging false or misleading claims a day according to the Washington Post and probably more than for his presidency Most were childishly transparent but were amplified by his Fox  propaganda channel and Fake  a term weaponised by Trump in January when cornered by a question he pointed at a CNN journalist and snarled you are fake news Every contemptuous dismissal since then is rooted in that reply Last week he tweeted fake news a dozen times But heres the good news at least he can take credit for one thriving new industry which is Fact Checking The world has seen a per cent increase in the number of factchecking organisations since his election according to the Duke Reporters Lab This is excellent Then again who cares if there is no Shame Trump has taught us that shame performs a vital democratic function and how dangerous is the man who feels none of it to quote Jonathan Freedland Such a man is capable of anything including Both Sidesism the moral equivalence assigned by Trump between white supremacistneoNazi marchers and antiracist protesters in Charlottesville very fine people on both sides blame assigned to both sides A selfdescribed neoNazi who rammed his car into protesters in the town killed year old Heather Heyer Both Sidesism is a cousin once removed from False Equivalence As long as Hillary Clintons emails continue to generate Trumpish lockherup chants the media will stand accused of the catastrophic consequences of false equivalence By hammering at the story relentlessly in they implicitly endorsed everything Trumpish including his signature Personal Insults When a bully boy can win the White House by throwing out lazy demeaning insults whats not to like for his minimes The Turkish president has twice described President Emmanuel Macron as a mental case Its now a universal infection and the cure lies with us as does our share of responsibility for Social media dominance In four years Trumps Twitter followers soared from million to Every single follower has boosted that global platform for a vengeful temperamental man to threaten war abroad and shooting at home Twitter finally took action by hidingand factchecking some tweets Facebook even deleted a recent post Its just a start But it may help to combat Populism For Trump predictably the real grinding policy stuff like the federal debt bringing back factory jobs draining the swamp accusing China of raping the US on trade soon morphed into selfserving diatribes about the China virus and Hunter Biden Do his voters care This is the moment when well learn whether what was at stake all along was identity and culture says author Anne Applebaum which brings us to Peter Thiel Remember when the PayPal cofounder and big Trump donor opined four years ago that the media went astray because they insisted on taking Trump literally but not seriously whereas his many voters took him seriously but not literally So when they heard things like the Muslim comment or the wall comment he said they interpreted that as were going to have a saner more sensible immigration policy Lets remember that lesson in moral slipperiness and relate it to the children in the cages Which brings us to IrishAmerican enablers Trumps passing parade of proud prolife IrishAmerican enablers was bewildering then hotly humiliating On the upside Americas third most powerful politician this term was a wellinformed Good Friday agreement supporter a woman with no Irish blood at all Heres to the new term Nancy Pelosi So how did the IrishAmerican enablers fare against The evangelicals Tens of millions of white and some prominent black evangelicals have provided cash votes and serious political underpinning for Trump Many Catholics joined them and got their judges but it was an evangelical pastor who got the nod as Trumps formal adviser on faith issues That was Paula White who once said that God believes Christians should be rewarded with material wealth and called for all satanic pregnancies to miscarry right now Lets hope at some stage there can be healing But some Texassized doses of humble pie wouldnt go amiss

journalist of his generation Lara Marlowe Wörter November      The word controversial has figured prominently in news stories and obituaries since the death of Robert Fisk I dislike the word because it seems to imply that Roberts immense achievements are in question If Robert was controversial it was because he refused to conform In nearly half a century as a journalist which saw him win numerous press awards and publish six books he never followed the herd His judgments were intuitive rapid and in my experience invariably right He could not be cowed by criticism He never jumped on the bandwagon I had the honour of being married to Robert Fisk for years Between and we worked together on most of the big news stories in the Middle East and Balkans In my opinion he was the finest journalist of his generation one of the finest ever No one did journalism with greater courage dedication determination and intelligence than Robert When Robert covered the Nato bombardment of Serbia from Belgrade in he was accused of supporting Slobodan Milosevic When he opposed the AngloAmerican invasion of Iraq four years later his enemies said he was a stooge for Saddam Hussein His coverage of the Syrian civil war since angered those who claimed he was an apologist for Bashar alAssad Robert did not praise or support any of these dictators Many in Europe and the US idealised the Syrian rebels at the beginning of the war Robert had a more nuanced vision He was proved right when many of the rebels joined jihadist movements Roberts first rule was to go there be a witness even if it meant risking his life He scorned cliches journalists who covered the Middle East from afar regurgitated the line peddled by governments and diplomats covered wars from hotel rooms Most of all he condemned journalists who did not care about the people they wrote about Robert refused to choose sides He knew there are executioners and victims on both sides of every civil war British public school a difficult relationship with his father and the years he spent covering the Troubles in Northern Ireland imbued him with profound mistrust of authority He never accepted the official version He sided instinctively with the underdog He gave voice to people who had none That is what made him a great journalist As a child Robert saw Alfred Hitchcocks Foreign Correspondent in which a US reporter tangles with Nazi agents in presecond World War Europe He credited the story of the fearless reporter who triumphs over evil and gets the girl with making him want to be a journalist With selfdeprecating humour Robert sometimes referred to himself as Scoop Fisk The tragedies of the modern Middle East were so great that more darkly he joked that he was mass graves correspondent Invasion of Lebanon As a young journalist in Paris I followed Roberts awardwinning coverage of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in the London Times We met the following year when I was on a reporting trip to Damascus for CBS  The Israeli invasion culminated in the massacre of at least a thousand Palestinians by Christian militiamen allied with Israel in the Sabra and Chatila refugee camps Robert was haunted by this image from his report published in the Faber Book of Reportage To the right of us there was what appeared to be a small barricade of concrete and mud But as we approached it we found a human elbow visible on the surface A large stone turned out to be part of a torso It was as if the bodies had been bulldozed to the side of the laneway as indeed they had A bulldozer its drivers seat empty stood guiltily just down the road Life with Robert was often harrowing and exhausting It was never dull Our first three summers together were interrupted by the shooting down of an Iranian passenger aircraft by the USS Vincennes in the death of Ayatollah Khomeini in and Saddam Husseins invasion of Kuwait in When Iran Air flight was shot down we rushed to Dubai We spent the entire night driving to various Gulf ports in the vain hope of chartering a boat to Bandar Abbas where the wreckage of the plane and the bodies of most of the victims had been taken As we straggled through our hotel lobby the following morning someone shouted The Iranians are taking a press plane to Bandar Abbas The corpses were lined up on the floor of a cold storage warehouse alongside piles of body parts limbs with limbs organs with organs The Iranians then took the journalists to the local hotel for a kebab lunch which many of us refused It was before mobile telephones We had no way to file Come with me Robert whispered We slipped into the switchboard operators cubbyhole behind the reception desk Robert handed the operator the telephone number of the London Times copydesk with a pleading look He dictated most of a frontpage story composing it in his head as he went along before someone pulled the plug His rivals were furious That night the Iranians flew dozens of western journalists who had made the trek to Bandar Abbas back to Dubai At the end of our excursion most of us were exhausted While others slept Robert slipped through the cockpit door and took the copilots seat We were on the first Iranian aircraft to repeat the trajectory of the doomed flight The pilot told him in perfect English how the transponder worked and why the US warship had not been able to communicate with the civilian aircraft The Americans had panicked the pilot concluded Back in Dubai Robert did more interviews that strengthened that thesis Subsequent investigations proved he was right But the Murdochowned newspaper wanted speculation about a civilian airliner on a kamikaze mission I witnessed a furious telephone argument between Robert and his foreign editor the beginning of the end of his long relationship with the Times of London When Robert announced the following year that he was leaving for the London Independent the editor of the Times invited him to an expensive restaurant in Paris You are quite simply Fisk of the Times the editor said Robert was polite but firm Those who criticise Israel including Robert are often unfairly labelled as antiSemitic He travelled to Auschwitz in an effort to understand the carnage he witnessed in the Middle East His masterpiece Pity the Nation begins with an evocation of the Holocaust He repeatedly told Arabs that yes the Holocaust really happened Yes it was really six million When the Oslo peace accords between Israel and the Palestinians were signed in September we rushed to Jerusalem where we shared a meal with my editors from Time magazine They believed peace had broken out and they were ebullient Have you read the fine print Robert asked The Israelis had more than lawyers working on the accord Yasser Arafat and Ahmed Qurei were virtually alone This cannot work Robert predicted The Palestinians will get blamed for it Again he was right Bombardment Robert and I were with Irish Unifil officers in southern Lebanon when the Israeli army bombarded Fijian battalion headquarters where hundreds of Shia Muslim civilians were sheltering during an Israeli assault in April We arrived within minutes upon a scene of utter horror Several of the survivors spoke of hearing and seeing an Israeli drone overhead at the time of the bombardment A Unifil officer who was not Irish leaked a videotape of the drone to Robert It showed the Israelis could have watched the massacre from the air as it took place His report made frontpage headlines Robert never let go of a story He went back to Cana and later to the scene of a Nato bombardment in Kosovo to reconstruct the life stories of those who perished This week those of us who loved Robert tried to smile through our tears His dear friend Olivia OLeary attended his funeral on Monday She told me this anecdote recounted by a former foreign editor of the London Times during the tanker war in the Persian Gulf Robert was annoyed that a report he had risked his life for was buried on the bottom of an inside page I do not mind dying for the Times he telexed London But please could it be on the front page Robert was eager to return to Beirut in October but was persuaded to wait until the pandemic eased When he was hospitalised at St Vincents on October Robert asked his wife Nelofer to tell his editor he would file the following week Robert often asked people if they believed in the afterlife He said it jokingly to break the ice If there was an afterlife he promised he would be the first journalist to file from there I half expect to read his report any day now

O’Leary Wörter November      Reporting on Europe can be a cacophonous experience On a typical day news will compete with Brexit developments against international geopolitics and the latest fight between big tech companies and EU regulators But the hubbub is rarely as dissonant as it was on Tuesday this week a day when EU leaders simultaneously lauded Muslim immigrants and raised suspicions about them Brussels would prefer the Pfizer vaccine that has elevated hopes of an end to the pandemic should be known as the BioNTech vaccine BioNTech is the German company that developed the key messenger RNA technology behind the vaccine and is working in partnership with the United Statesbased pharmaceutical giant to develop and produce it The founders of the company are a husband and wife team Drs Ugur Sahin and Ozlem Tureci two scientists of a Turkish background so dedicated to their work that on the day of their marriage they returned to the lab after their wedding ceremony The vaccines promising result in an initial trial set off a rush by politicians to take credit and associate themselves with the good news story As officials from the administration of Donald Trump would have it this was a US victory They falsely claimed Pfizer had received funding from the US governments Operation Warp Speed vaccine acceleration programme It had not but BioNTech did get funding from the German goverment In Germany itself where studies have shown people of Turkish descent are discriminated against in both education and employment the story of Drs Sahin and Türeci was immediately coopted for use in the countrys longrunning debates about immigration Where Brussels is concerned the vaccine is a European win In statements from the European Commission its pointedly described as German company BioNTech with Pfizer mentioned second Combatting terrorism On the very same day the commission was proudly announcing it had secured million doses of the vaccine it also announced that it would soon present a new European agenda on combating terrorism including an action plan for integration and inclusion of migrants This declaration came after a video conference of several top EU leaders hosted by French president Emmanuel Macron and Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz Macron and Kurz have teamed up to push the EU to adopt an antiterror strategy in the wake of a string of attacks in Vienna Nice and the outskirts of Paris Their endeavour has given a boost to some sensible proposals that had already been agreed but never finalised such as datasharing and more cooperation between police forces But extremely questionable suggestions have emerged from this debate too Some are farcical like the call of European Council president Charles Michel for a European Institute to train imams that should be set up as soon as possible a hubristic notion suggesting an image that would be at home in the pages of Charlie Hebdo Perhaps more concerning is the call by Austrias Kurz for the creation of a criminal offence called political Islam to take action against those who are not terrorists themselves but who create the breeding ground for such Kurz suggested this could be part of a package allowing mosques to be shut down and the introduction of an imams register Proposals like this suggest state overreach and the risk of indiscriminate targeting of a marginalised minority But they should perhaps be understood as political messaging more than straightforward policy ideas an attempt to compete with farright antiimmigration groups by adopting their rhetoric The very bundling of the question of migration together with terrorism and security policy is in itself an adoption of farright assumptions which makes a stigmatising assertion about a large and diverse group of European citizens who largely have nothing to do with extremism or violence Kurz is a longtime hardliner on immigration who has only been recently chastened by his coalition with the Green party Macrons shift to this rhetoric is newer and comes as he transitions from the great new hope of European centrist politics into a figure who can compete with the farright Marine Le Pen in the elections of To do so he has set off what the New York Times has described as a broadbrush crackdown on Islamists and some Muslim organizations with language that appeared to conflate Islam the religion with Islamism an ideology that has sometimes led to violence In a recent opinion piece the Financial Timess Brussels correspondent Mehreen Khan warned Muslims would need to be Macrons strongest allies in any fight against extremism and that such policies and language risked counterproductively alienating them This piece can no longer be read It was retracted whole by the newspaper following a complaint by Macron himself who pointed out a misquotation which in the circumstances is a highly ironic censorious result 
332,../data/sec_IRL/Irish Times/Factiva-20230807-165,Features A cycling accident left Des Vallely with brain injury Now he’s trying to go home Sheila Wayman Wörter November      Last New Years Eve when midnight struck to welcome in Tara Dalton kissed her husband Des Vallely and said it cant be any worse than last year because his widowed father had died in A week later their lives fell apart On the morning of January hours after Des had dropped their two children to their national school in south Dublin he suffered catastrophic brain injuries in a fall from his electric bike in the city centre Daniel and Ella Rose didnt see their father again for another six months and when they did he was in a wheelchair unable to speak and with a very large dent in his head where half his skull had been removed during lifesaving surgery at Beaumont hospital The arrival here at the end of February of the coronavirus which has brought grief and disruption to so many people added another layer of complication to this personal tragedy Recurring bans on hospital visitors made Tara feel that Des being locked away like a prisoner from his family was doing him no favours for his rehabilitation After a period of being able to see him daily in St Vincents hospital she had to go for a whole month without being with him in May after he was transferred to the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dún Laoghaire He needed to stay in bed for much of that time too to allow an infection site to heal He really regressed and it was awful After about a month they got me in I was one of the first to be allowed in He had stopped whispering wasnt swallowing anything anymore and he had stiffened up hugely I believe it took him about two months after I came in to be back to where he was To her it seemed a total waste of precious time Highly emotional moments It was July before the children were reunited with him She shows me the video she captured on her phone of those highly emotional moments as both children hug their beaming father a smile says Tara that lasted minutes and one she hadnt seen before or since When it was announced in midSeptember that Dublin was moving to Level reimposing hospital visitor restrictions she resolved that she had to bring him home He needs us and we need him she says simply But to make that happen is dauntingly complex logistically financially and emotionally She gathered friends with different relevant areas of expertise to help devise a fundraising campaign Walk Des Home iegofundmecomfwalkdeshomevallelyfamilyappeal Having worked out that costs for fulltime care and nursing would come to about € for two years she remembers telling a friend thats what she needed to raise and while the friend didnt say anything Tara could read the are you for real expression on her face I didnt know whether I would raise € or € but it was amazing how well it went She feels the video that accompanies the gofundme appeal has helped drive it to the threequarters mark at the time of writing Its at when Tara feels most overwhelmed and plagued with doubts about whats ahead I start to panic and think am I doing the right thing What if he gets sick Despite all the amazing support of extended family friends and neighbours she knows everybody has to get on with their own lives Youre on your own at the end of the day Although spared the ultimate bereavement Tara and the children are dealing with many losses Des her husband of years coparent business partner and my best friend has gone from her side and she is heartbroken for him We had plans and dreams and theyve all gone out the window The reality of it is I dont know if Ill ever get them back Its really cruel for him He is a big active man full of life really positive For that to be taken away from him I actually dont know how hes coping He does have a little bit of movement on the lefthand side and he has virtually nothing on the righthand side although he can wiggle his fingers and wiggle his toes so there is a signal getting through He can stand with bent legs but he cant walk She hangs on to the belief that the brain is one of those organs that can do extraordinary things Nothing might come but people have defied the odds over and over again when they doctors said nothing would happen For now Des communicates through whispers blinks of the eyes when on video phone and uses a grid to type out words On her last weekly visit to him before this interview she asked him how he was feeling and he typed okay and she said no how are you really feeling are you sad are you frustrated He typed out I am going to get better She reckons he knows exactly what is going on and occasionally wonders would it be better if he didnt But because he does know he can work on it There is a way to push it If he didnt know there would be very little hope While chatting to Des a number of weeks ago he typed out Whats the plan Not knowing what he was referring to she asked whats the plan for what He typed IVM which is their business Irish Village Markets He wanted to know what was going on with that For a brain injury it is still early days says Tara They look at years not months or weeks There is still a lot of time to improve and he may have to go to England or Germany for more intensive rehab but the thing is to get him home for now and see how he improves I know it is going to be very challenging but we have to give it a go and it will give him his very best chance She has very dark days she says her hazelbrown eyes above a blue face mask transmitting inner sorrow and exhaustion I went through a phase when the anxiety was just unbelievable Id wake up in the morning and you get a couple of seconds and then Id feel it creeping up and it just went on and on Brought to a halt Not only did bring Dess accident but then the couples food markets business was brought to a halt by the pandemic Dess younger brother died in a fall in Spain in April and the health of Taras father deteriorated further after he had a stroke in his nursing home People say youre so strong and I just say am I I dont have any choice I have got two kids I just have to get up and get on with it and try and make something out of it She worries about how the children are coping especially now theyre having to move house so that Des can come to live with them as their own home in Monkstown is not suitable My is really struggling Des would have coached his football team he would have been a very strong male influence in his life And I am struggling with him I think he really misses Des but he wont really talk about it If anybody brings it up he just changes the subject My nineyearold is a girl she is easier to deal with She has her moments she cries she misses Dad we talk and she gets on with it Kids are quite resilient they learn just to accept and deal with whats what But I know it is having a big impact on them deep down They have seen their father just four times since January and Daniel has made the big transition to secondary school since That was really difficult just Des not being there Tara too found the first few days after the schools reopened really hard You saw other parents congregating and laughing and I just felt so on my own That was horrible actually She feels Daniel and Ella Rose have been through enough trauma without uprooting them from their area and friends so despite the frightfully expensive rents in south Dublin she has found a suitable new property to rent in nearby Glenageary where the builder offered to make a necessary adaptation Her longerterm plan is to find a site on which they could build from scratch Although November was the original date for Dess discharge from the NRH that has been extended while Tara gets his transfer organised and she hopes to be in their new home by the beginning of December So many people have told me that once you leave the NRH youre on your own really I need to have everything in place The Royal Hospital Donnybrook could be okay for him for stepdown rehab she says but she believes bringing him home would be best and is adamant that the other institutional option open to him a nursing home is not on I cannot put my husband in a nursing home I think hed die to be honest Even though I am really nervous and think I am well aware of the task in hand I am really oking forward to him coming home She recalls a comment Martina Cox made in a recent interview about missing the presence of her husband Seán the Liverpool supporter who suffered a brain injury in an assault by a rival fan before she got him back into their Co Meath home I can really relate to that even if Des isnt speaking just to be with him Having grown up in Monkstown as one of two daughters of the local Church of Ireland rector the Rev Kevin Dalton and his wife Jennifer she has found some comfort in that upbringing Its amazing how you start to pray when something like this happens I am not overly religious as my Dad would say Im not gospel greedy But its all you have to hold on to Her mother has described the situation as beyond sad and Tara says Des is like the son she never had He had stepped in to help around her mothers house when her father who is years older than his wife had to go to a nursing home Shes really devastated as well Fundraising campaign Tara being a very private person found it hard to put herself out there to launch the fundraising campaign My even bigger worry was how will Des feel about it I couldnt really ask him because we didnt have a choice if we wanted to bring him home But again Des wouldnt want his private business out there and I worried if Des would want people to see him in a wheelchair and the situation he is in But in hindsight it was definitely the right thing to do Everybody has been so positive and so supportive It has been amazing She believes the simple but devastating nature of an accident that could happen to anyone resonated with people Des was wearing a helmet but it was just his head hit the wrong place a low concrete divider at the edge of the cycle lane Both her children ride bicycles and Tara has been terrified something would happen to them too Ella Rose only goes out with her friends mum and doesnt cycle on her own at all But Daniel does and I just have to swallow it I cant stop him cycling with his friends that would be wrong The other thing is hes playing rugby… she trails off nightmare imaginings of concussion or a broken neck left unspoken You cant let your own fears rub off on your kids its not fair she adds firmly Despite her initial reservations running the campaign has been a blessing in disguise because it keeps her busy Youre tied up in it and then you stop and it suddenly hits you why youre doing it I still havent fully got my head around what has happened I still see him some days and get a shock that this is Des in a wheelchair totally disabled 
333,../data/sec_IRL/Irish Times/Factiva-20230807-165,Ireland Ethiopia turning into big political mess that makes fathers fight sons’ Political crisis has set Ethiopian against Ethiopian in a national conflict David Pilling Andres Schipani Wörter November      Gashaw Koye a farmer from Amhara dressed in crisp new battle fatigues met his wife from the neighbouring region of Tigray more than two decades ago Now as part of an army mustered by Abiy Ahmed Ethiopias prime minister he is preparing to fight Tigrays regional government It is bad enough that Gashaw may have to battle people from his former wifes northern homeland Worse among the soldiers fighting for the Tigray Peoples Liberation Front or TPLF is the couples son Amanuel There is little love lost between the regions of Amhara and Tigray which have longrunning land disputes along their shared border That animosity is now part of a broader national conflict in Ethiopia a country of million people in the Horn of Africa I am going to have to fight the terrorists of the TPLF for the good of Ethiopia says Gashaw referring to the regional party that ran the country for almost three decades but is now considered by some to be a rogue force This means I may have to fight my own son He is speaking as dozens of militiamen like him most brandishing rifles clamber aboard buses and trucks in the city of Gondar to be transported across the border to Tigray This is what Ethiopia has become says Gashaw stroking his own wellworn rifle A big political mess that makes fathers fight sons The political crisis that has set Ethiopian against Ethiopian began in the early hours of November when Abiy launched what he called a law enforcement operation replete with air strikes and a ground troops operation against the TPLF The prime minister an army intelligence officer when the TPLF was running the country said he was left with no choice after the northern command of the federal defence forces based in the Tigrayan capital of Mekelle were attacked when they were at their most vulnerable in their pyjamas With the eyes of the world focused on the US election Ethiopian forces bombed arms depots and other targets in Tigray The army together with militias and regional special forces began a ground attack that Abiy says has already liberated large parts of Tigray from the TPLF The conflict has quickly spread On Saturday the TPLF slammed rockets into Asmara capital of Eritrea a neighbouring country after accusing the secretive state which broke away from Ethiopia in the early of siding with Abiy The TPLF has also fired missiles at the airport in Amharas capital Bahir Dar and at Gashaws home town of Gondar This is the gravest crisis of Abiys tumultuous premiership one that has already included the award of a Nobel Peace Prize for concluding a peace deal with Eritrea an assassination attempt and an attempted coup It threatens to scupper any chance of credible democratic elections next year which had already been made harder by the arrest of senior opposition figures The fear is that war in Tigray could trigger a humanitarian crisis and widespread ethnic and political violence in a country that although deeply divided had been regarded by many as a model of economic progress in Africa Some even fear that it could precipitate a Yugoslaviastyle breakup of Ethiopia along ethnic lines The country with a history of independent states stretching back three millennia is divided into ethnically defined regions each with their own distinct language culture and history There are eerie similarities with Yugoslavia except Yugoslavia imploded says Payton Knopf senior adviser to the Africa programme at the United States Institute of Peace If you do see fragmentation in Ethiopia it wont just collapse in on itself but it will become a black hole that draws in all of its neighbours As well as the bombing of Eritrea there are already signs that the conflict just two weeks old is having a regional impact More than refugees have fled into Sudan a fragile state illequipped to cope with a sudden influx of people If the conflict persists the UN warns that tens of thousands more could follow Leaders of the African Union and other international organisations have called for an immediate ceasefire and dialogue That doesnt look likely for now as different sides in the conflict dig into entrenched and seemingly irreconcilable positions As in most wars truth or at least verifiable truth has been the first casualty especially on social media where misinformation and hate speech was already rife Losing power To Abiys supporters the federal government has been pushed to its limit by the TPLF which ever since losing power three years ago has they say been spoiling for a fight Abiy accused the TPLF of defying central authority by holding regional elections in September after a national poll in which he would have faced the electorate was postponed until next year because of the coronavirus pandemic The final straw said Abiy was reached at on November when the TPLF attacked the northern command stationed in Mekelle The government reported deaths on both sides Such a treasonous act left us no option but to mobilise our law enforcement and defence machinery in an operation intended to end the prevailing lawlessness in the region Abiy said He has since blamed the TPLF for the killing of hundreds of civilians in a gruesome attack reported by Amnesty International last week in which mainly nonTigrayans were stabbed and hacked to death in the Tigrayan town of Mai Kadra The massacre fits a pattern the government said of TPLFsponsored violence targeting other ethnic groups The TPLF and its supporters dismiss such accounts as propaganda intended to demonise the party and justify war Ezekiel Gebissa an ethnic Oromo who advocates strong regional rights and is assistant professor of history at Kettering University in Michigan says Abiy had been moving army divisions towards Tigray for weeks in preparation for an attack Ethnic violence The fear is that ethnic violence regardless of who is responsible could provoke titfortat killings around the country On Sunday the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission said an attack on bus passengers in BenishangulGumuz one of the countrys regions had left at least people dead Human Rights Watch warned that rhetoric against the TPLF was taking on a potentially dangerous antiTigrayan tinge The federal parliament has ratcheted up pressure on Tigrays government by issuing arrest warrants against dozens of members of the TPLF leadership for endangering the countrys existence To his critics blame for the violence now convulsing the country lies with Abiy The crisis they say has been fed by his attempt to amass too much power at the centre in defiance of a federalist constitution that devolves authority to ethnically constituted regions Abiy wants to unify Ethiopia under his medemer philosophy says Prof Gebissa referring to the prime ministers use of an Amharic word signifying strength through diversity to define his panEthiopian vision But medemer simply means assimilation and the flattening of identity into one Anyone who stands in Abiys way is his enemy Ethiopia has been drifting towards conflict for months if not years At the heart of this crisis one of several regional disputes in the country is the position of the TPLF in national politics Last year it refused to join Abiys newly established Prosperity party a nonethnic organisation based on his medemer doctrine Loss of power has come as a shock to the TPLF which ran the country for years following its lead role in the overthrow of the hated Marxist Derg regime in Although Tigrays five million people make up only per cent of Ethiopias population the TPLF became the dominant force in a national fourparty coalition known as the Ethiopian Peoples Revolutionary Democratic Front Under Meles Zenawi a brilliant strategist and prime minister from until his sudden death in the EPRDF embarked on an Asianstyle development drive modelled loosely on South Korea Once a byword for famine the country began to make palpable progress both in terms of economic growth as well as in health education and infrastructure Though the TPLF was deeply authoritarian it won many international plaudits Dani Rodrik professor of economics at Harvard University says Meless effort to transform Ethiopia from a povertystricken peasant economy into a middleincome country scored real successes Back then if you were to tell the IMF and World Bank that your growth model was going to be ramping up public investment from low singledigits to per cent of gross domestic product and to get annual per cent growth theyd have said you were totally crazy says Rodrik of the countrys stateled model Yet they did just that for two decades Politically however the experiment was unsustainable Domination of the federal government by Tigrayans bred resentment The government operated a police state in which neighbours spied on neighbours both to further the governments development goals such as use of prescribed fertiliser or participation in vaccination campaigns as well as to report on unauthorised political activity After Meless death in the system began to crumble Mass street protests erupted in Oromia which has long felt marginalised from power even though its people make up more than onethird of Ethiopias population Unusually Oromo protesters joined forces with those from Amhara the traditional seat of Ethiopian power which also felt bitterly towards TPLF rule In the ensuing years security forces shot thousands of protesters and imprisoned and exiled thousands more The governments solution to the crisis was to appoint a new prime minister In April over TPLF objections it selected Abiy an Oromo son of a Muslim father and a Christian mother and a fluent speaker of Amharic Oromo and Tigrinya the languages of Ethiopias three largest ethnic groups There are in all The hope was that Abiys appointment could ease tensions particularly in Oromia At first it appeared to work Brandishing a liberalsounding agenda he released political prisoners invited back those who had gone into exile and concluded peace with Eritrea The countries had fought a bitter war between and But Abiy also purged Tigrayans from government and the security service and led a crackdown on corruption that members of the TPLF old guard saw as targeted against them Although he had been part of the old regime he labelled the era of TPLF control as years of darkness Worku Adamu a senior member of Abiys Prosperity party says the TPLF is mourning its loss of power For years the TPLF controlled the whole system and the new government captured this power Belete Molla chairman of the National Movement of Amhara also regards the TPLF as the villain of the piece He blames Abiy not for waging war on Tigray but for failing to do so sooner This is what he should have done two years back The TPLF has always been a mafia group says Belete accusing it of orchestrating massacres across Ethiopia Debretsion Gebremichael chairman of the TPLF denies any such activity laying the blame for the crisis squarely with Abiy He is a dictator a complete dictator he said on a telephone call from Tigray last week after federal forces attacked Abiy pretended to be a reformer and a democrat but deep inside he was planning to be a king Debretsion accuses the prime minister of colluding with Isaias Afewerki Eritreas authoritarian leader whose troops he said had already infiltrated Tigray If the fighting continues Debretsion says he does not see how Ethiopia can remain intact If these people dont come to their senses breakup will be a natural consequence of this kind of fighting he added National identity Abiy has defended action in Tigray as a restoration of law and order and rejects the description of the conflict as a civil war More broadly say his supporters he is trying to create a unified national identity in which ethnicity recedes in importance and a new sense of national citizenry takes hold National unity is a priority nation building is a priority says Billene Seyoum Mr Abiys spokeswoman Ethnic entrepreneurs those seeking to manufacture unrest want to keep dividing this country forever says another close aide of the prime minister Ethnicity is being used by these people as a political weapon Elsewhere in Ethiopia Abiy faces calls for separation among ethnic groups in the south as well as violence in parts of Oromia Senior Oromo opposition leaders including Jawar Mohammed have been arrested For the moment Abiy is concentrating on Tigray where he says the operation can be wrapped up quickly But most experts fear conflict will drag on as experienced and wellarmed TPLF fighters dig in It is not clear that Abiys forces have a military advantage going into this war The TPLF is not a ragtag band of guerrillas says Knopf of the US Institute of Peace Even if somehow they are able to hunt down the whole Tigrayan leadership how are you going to subjugate the Tigrayan population he asks I dont see where this is supposed to end Back

334,../data/sec_IRL/Irish Times/Factiva-20230807-165,Opinion Successor to Martin must be cut from same cloth Irish Catholic Church about to lose its most influential leader as Rome gets set to replace Archbishop of Dublin Patsy McGarry Wörter November      The Irish Catholic Church stands at a critical juncture It is about to lose its most influential leader Archbishop of Dublin Diarmuid Martin But for the pandemic he would have been replaced already He was last April the age when all bishops must submit a letter of resignation to Rome and he was ready to step down An announcement on his successor is expected before Christmas Recent events were a reminder of his achievements in one critical area that of child protection in the Irish Catholic Church He was not alone in this but his unequivocal approach to the issue while placing survivors and the protection of children at its centre set the tone He also set the bar for dealing with statutory inquiries unlike other senior church figures He fully cooperated with the Murphy Commission which investigated the handling of clerical child sexual abuse in the Dublin archdiocese Such cooperation was not forthcoming from Rome the papal nunciature in Dublin or his predecessor Cardinal Desmond Connell who initiated a High Court action to prevent the commission having access to documents He was persuaded to drop the action Where some in the church are concerned Archbishop Martins commitment and integrity on the abuse issue has meant that from a clerical point of view he will never be forgiven For its part Rome has only ever been lukewarm in its acknowledgement To paraphrase Shakespeare Martin did the job not wisely but too well It is imperative that whoever succeeds him as Archbishop of Dublin must be cut from the same cloth He must be someone who has at a minimum a clean pair of hands personally on the abuse issue and be just as committed to the protection of children and to helping survivors The appointment will be made by the papal nuncio and Rome with little input from the current incumbent as a clean break is the ambition However in Rome it includes the very curia whose record in child protection does not shine to say the least A report published on November by the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse IICSA in the Catholic Church of England and Wales was a reminder It found the church there repeatedly failed to support victims and survivors while taking positive action to protect alleged perpetrators Its senior leaders have been resistant to external oversight and have only partially implemented the recommendations of previous independent reviews Show compassion The most senior Catholic leader in England and Wales Cardinal Vincent Nichols had the report noted failed to acknowledge any personal responsibility or show compassion for victims in the recent cases we examined He it said has shown he cares more about the impact of child sexual abuse on the Catholic Churchs reputation than on victims and survivors The Cardinal has refused to stand down with the approval of Pope FrancisThat same day a report was also published by the Vatican It found that former cardinal and archbishop of Washington Theodore McCarrick was elevated by pope St John Paul in despite credible abuse allegations against him The decision followed a letter to the late pope from McCarrick denying everything The report found that bishops cardinals as well as pope St John Paul II and Emeritus pope Benedict XVI downplayed or dismissed reports that McCarrick had slept with seminarians and that not one of those senior clerics expressed any concern for the seminarians only about implications for the church if McCarrick was found out Pope Francis it found continued the approach of his predecessors until a former altar boy alleged abuse by McCarrick Then in Pope Francis removed McCarrick from public ministry who then resigned as a cardinal In February of last year McCarrick was removed from the priesthood after being found guilty of abuse by a church inquiry Then on November last and following a documentary on Polish TV senior Catholic clerics in Poland called for a Vatican inquiry into allegations that Cardinal Stanislaw Dziwisz personal secretary to pope St John Paul II chose not to act on clerical sexual abuse claims Cardinal Dziwisz was also found by that Vatican report to have played a role in the elevation of McCarrick A tweet from Dublin abuse survivor Marie Collins following publication of the Vatican report summed up the feelings of many practising Catholics like herself and of many others Reports excuses promises mean little to me anymore Clericalism is alive and well marching forward unhindered Few lay people have had as much experience of dealing with the clerical mindset on the abuse issue as Collins has had whether initially with the late cardinal Connell in Dublin or as a member of the Vaticans Commission for the Protection of Minors to which she was appointed by Pope Francis in She resigned in March in utter frustration at how its work was being impeded by officials in the Roman curia the body that runs the church from the Vatican Lasting changes Her experience is referred to in the IICSA report as an example of how real and lasting changes to attitudes have some way to go if the Roman Catholic Church is to shake off the failures of the past That report found that individual leaders in the Catholic Church as in other institutions set the tone for how the organisation responded to the major issues with which they were confronted through their words and deeds In the Catholic Church of England and Wales it said weaknesses in leadership were significant in the failures to address child sexual abuse So so familiar Weve been there in Dublin and Ireland There can be no going back Patsy McGarry is religious affairs correspondent

339,../data/sec_IRL/Irish Times/Factiva-20230807-165,Finance Not even Covid could squash our enthusiasm for shopping Mark Paul Wörter Dezember      If ever there is a nuclear attack two species are odds on to survive the fallout cockroaches and Irish consumers Both are stamped on abused and occasionally scorned by their many detractors who simply dont like the look of them even though theyre basically harmless Sometimes they may even go into hiding if it all gets too much to bear But they always scurry back seemingly unscathed Considering the year that theyve had hit by a plague and a dystopian upending of the old economic order consumers ought to be cowering under their duvets reading old shopping catalogues by torchlight clutching credit cards then sobbing themselves to sleep to a lullaby of store jingles Yet there they are on course to spend almost as much this Christmas as last year and with consumer sentiment back up to where it was in March Irish shoppers are not illogical KBCs consumer sentiment index this week acknowledges that consumer conditions this month would be mixed not marvellous But Irish consumers Chumbawumbalike ability to get up again in reach of some semblance of normality in even the most hostile of environments is remarkable and worthy of note Try as we might to deny it rampant consumerism has been a feature of Irish life for decades One of the most surreal things I have known in business journalism is the giddy ecumenical service that was held in to mark the official opening of the Dundrum Town Centre Okay it was during the manic phase of the Celtic Tiger when gathering a Catholic priest a Methodist and a Church of Ireland minister to bless a shopping centre didnt seem at all like a wacky thing to do But still God of Beauty may we see in the magnificence of this centre a reflection of your beauty variety brightness and colour may it fill us with wonder and may it raise our hearts and spirits to you they prayed as recounted in a contemporaneous report by my Irish Times colleague Rosita Boland Retail therapy It sounds a bit psychedelic reading that report back Shopping then and now truly has become something close to a national religion I wouldnt be at all surprised if the sprawling Dundrum centre one of the most successful malls in Europe outlasts some of the churches in its vicinity Im neither lauding that possibility nor decrying it Its mere plausibility is objectively the interesting part We can see with our own eyes today further evidence that retail therapy is one of the most resilient aspects of modern Irish life According to various reports when the first lockdown ended in early summer and Penneys reopened on Dublins Mary Street people queued around the block from You could write that off as an anomaly a onceoff collective freakout caused by the emotional stress of having just spent eight weeks locked up with nobody but our laptops to amuse us But again there they were at the end of the second lockdown earlier this month queuing around the block on Mary Street in the morning darkness caring not a whit what anybody thought I have a sneaking sense of respect for it Its a bit like Javier Bardem in No Country for Old Men Sheer indivertible relentlessness In fairness the reports also suggest the Penneys customers didnt begin queuing the second time around until about two hours later than the previous occasion But Im struggling to figure out whether in an Irish context that is progress or regress Perhaps it had something to do with the solstice Three years ago this month the Victorias Secret lingerie shop opened on Dublins Grafton Street and they needed security staff outside to keep the women and girls in line According to a report in this newspaper by Tanya Sweeney the crowd started chanting VS Dublin VS Dublin as the staff cut the ribbon at It even attracted a sort of counter protest from animal rights campaigners angry at the stocking of products tested on animals in contrast to a previous longstanding policy There is just something about shopping that makes Irish people go a little swiveleyed If the medics ever get their way and pubs finally go the way of the dodo well just move all the sessions to Lidl and Aldi There is statistical evidence to back up this prejudiced anecdotal truthiness Ibecs latest quarterly economic outlook highlighted how the predicted € billion of consumer spending this December is only a little bit below where it might have been if there hadnt been a nearexistential crisis for humankind Recent monthly data from the digital payments platform Revolut shows that consumer spending in the prior two months actually was up on previous years And here is perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the whole thing Irish consumers behave this way even when they are scared out of their wits Consumer sentiment data shows that people living in Ireland were among the most fearful of the virus at the outset of the pandemic consumer activity briefly plunging in the spring by per cent the second biggest fall in Europe before recovering at warp speed as we realised that the State was opening its coffers and this wasnt going to be all over again Recent research from Deloitte meanwhile shows Irish consumers were the most anxious in Europe for an eightweek stretch in the runup to the recent lockdown It didnt stop a feverish national debate about the fairness of closing shops when there is scant evidence they contribute much to virus spread nor did it prevent us spending like drunken sailors once we were let out again Bravery To be afraid yet to persevere anyway is supposed to be the hardboiled definition of bravery You can debate the merits and the relative bravery of say fearlessly dropping € on shirts and jeans versus the genuine bravery required to battle an illness or save someone from drowning Consumption isnt literal bravery We know that perfectly well But in its own way it can demonstrate a form of individual resilience a determination to keep on keeping on no matter what fresh hell lies around the corner In a year turned upside down by an awful virus when the everyday rituals of life were torn up in ways that we never imagined possible the simple mission of making it to the shops come what may seems to me at least to be a very modern Irish way of coping If nothing else it is something to smirk stubbornly about while we wait out the darkness of winter and the arrival of the vaccines Merry Christmas

343,../data/sec_IRL/Irish Times/Factiva-20230807-165,Letters Israel Palestine and vaccinations Wörter Januar      Sir In recent weeks Israel has been lauded for the successful rollout of a vaccination programme With more than a million vaccination doses already administered the Israeli healthcare system continues to be a model for coexistence as Jewish Muslim and Christian Israeli healthcare staff work together to achieve the best outcomes for their patients It is a truly exciting development not just for Israelis but for the world if soon we will have evidence of how these vaccinations can halt the spread of It is therefore disappointing that two members of the Oireachtas Patrick Costello TD Letters January and Senator Michael McDowell Opinion Analysis January have chosen to make misleading allegations about the situation between Israel and the Palestinian Authority Those who are truly concerned with the issue of the Covid crisis in the Palestinian areas should take the time to educate themselves as to the facts Had they done this they would have learned that as per the Oslo Accords and other treaties between Israel and the Palestinian Authority civic responsibilities including the provision of health services is exclusively under the remit of the Palestinian Authority PA The PA has been negotiating the supplying of vaccines with various suppliers as well as with relevant international organisations In addition to this Israel will do whatever is needed to facilitate the supply of such vaccines to the Palestinian Authority Despite the fact that the Palestinian Authority has sole responsibility for the healthcare of its population it hasnt always acted in its populations best interest but rather chose to politicise the situation For months the PA attempted to deny Palestinians medical treatment in Israel for political reasons by stopping civil coordination with Israel however the PA made an exception in the case of the late Saeb Erekat At the height of the Covid crisis the PA refused shipments of personal protective equipment only because the Emirati airplane carrying that aid landed in Israel Through months of that crisis the PA refused again for political reasons to receive hundreds of millions of euro in tax revenues from Israel which are transferred every month under the existing accords thus inflicting even more suffering on their own people and aggravating the Covid crisis in the Palestiniancontrolled areas At the same time realising the humanitarian effects of the pandemic and knowing that the virus knows no borders Israel initiated highlevel cooperation with the Palestinians in the battle against Despite the cynical actions of the PA Israel has done its utmost to assist by training Palestinian medical staff both from the West Bank and Gaza by facilitating the supply of thousands of donated test kits large volumes of personal protective equipment and assisting with other aid activities The UN Special Coordinator for Middle East Peace Nikolay Mladenov has hailed this cooperation as exemplary Rather than hijacking the global Covid crisis to further an extremist antiIsrael agenda those who claim to support the Palestinian people should perhaps look into the irresponsible conduct of the Palestinian leadership and urge them to put the welfare of its own people above any political whims Yours etc ORLI WEITZMAN Deputy Ambassador of Israel Ballsbridge Dublin Sir As asserted by Alan Shatter Letters January the Palestinian Authority under the terms of the Oslo Agreement which was signed in was responsible for the administration of the health system for Palestinians in Occupied Territory However what Mr Shatter fails to mention is that the Oslo Agreement was intended to be an interim agreement The interim fiveyear period elapsed without any further progress and years later Palestine including Jerusalem remains a state under occupation Israel as the occupying power has reneged time and time again on its obligations under international law as an occupying power Under international law the occupying power is responsible for the treatment of the local citizens under its occupying authority As we are an occupied state we cannot raise our own revenues and are therefore on the back foot when it comes to competing for vaccine doses on a world stage Due to the stranglehold of the occupation our health system is badly underfunded and relies on help from NGOs and international aid to keep it operating at the most basic level of function The profound effect of inequalities in access to healthcare including the much coveted limited supply of vaccines on a nations ability to respond to Covid has been well articulated by leading experts such as Mike Ryan of the World Health Organisation WHO When the pandemic was first announced we began immediate preparations to try to contain the virus and cushion the blow to our health service This was made inordinately harder by the withholding of our tax revenues by the occupying power Israel the blockade of Gaza and the defunding of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency UNRWA We simply could not afford to pay the premiums the occupying state did to secure early access to vaccines Instead we are working with the WHO to secure vaccines as part of its scheme for poor and middleincome countries Contrary to recent reports from Israeli media the Palestinian Authority has indeed been in touch with Israeli officials and has asked to purchase doses of the vaccine which they have managed to secure We have not yet had a response which is not unusual Withholding essential medical supplies is not a new Israeli tactic Mr Shatter notes that the Israeli Government has been actively encouraging Israels Arab population to get vaccinated No one has questioned the availability of the vaccine to the Arab population of Israel The profound discriminatory feature of Israels vaccination programme that it is administering vaccines to the settler population deep within Palestinian Territory while failing to offer the vaccine to the Palestinian population under its control within that same territory has presented the entire world with unprecedented challenges but the harsh reality is that Palestine as a country under occupation has the added disadvantage of a beleaguered economy and healthcare system as a result of a decades old occupation Our population in the West Bank has the added challenge of watching on while illegal settlers on Palestinian land are administered a vaccination under an internationally acclaimed vaccination programme and they remain at risk unvaccinated and with no end in sight Yours etc SARAH HOLLAND Communications Officer Mission of the State of Palestine Dublin

Wörter Januar      US president Joe Biden unveiled an ambitious immigration plan on his first day in office pledging to present a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants living in the country Speaking at the first press briefing of the Biden presidency hours after the inauguration new White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that the president had sent an immigration Bill to Congress The US Citizenship Act modernises our immigration system provides hardworking people who have enriched our communities and lived here for decades an opportunity to earn citizenship she said Among the proposals in the act is an eightyear path to citizenship for the estimated million undocumented people living in the United States The initiative marks a significant break with Donald Trumps antiimmigration policy and has been welcomed by groups representing undocumented Irish in the US But it will need agreement in Congress a formidable challenge that has eluded previous presidents Mr Biden also revoked his predecessors ban on immigrants from certain Muslimmajority nations and halted the construction of the border wall with Mexico The immigration initiative was one of several actions taken by the new president Within hours of his inauguration he had signed an executive order pledging to rejoin the Paris climate agreement That paves the way for the United States to officially rejoin in days It reverses one of the signature actions of Mr Trump who withdrew from the international agreement in June with the US officially leaving the compact late last year The landmark international agreement which was signed by president Barack Obama in late introduced binding emission targets on countries in a bid to limit global warming to below two degrees Celsius But in a measure of Republican resistance to the move GOP senator Ted Cruz denounced the action claiming that Mr Biden was prioritising the citizens of Paris over the citizens of Pittsburgh By rejoining the Paris climate agreement President Biden indicates hes more interested in the views of the citizens of Paris than in the jobs of the citizens of Pittsburgh This agreement will do little to affect the climate and will harm the livelihoods of Americans he said Mr Biden also suspended contracts related to the construction of the Keystone oil pipeline which has long been opposed by environmental groups But other stakeholders including the Canadian government and the US chamber of commerce voiced opposition to the move As expected Mr Biden also announced that the United States would remain a member of the World Health Organisation the UN body which elicited the ire of Mr Trump Outlining his decision in a letter to UN secretary general António Guterres Mr Biden said that the WHO plays a crucial role in the worlds fight against the deadly pandemic as well as countless other threats to global health and health security The United States will continue to be a full participant and a global leader in confronting such threats and advancing global health and health security Mr Biden was sworn in as the countrys president at a scaleddown inauguration ceremony at the US Capitol on

opposition leader Daniel McLaughlin Wörter Januar      In All the Kremlins Men his study of Russian president Vladimir Putins closest allies and fiercest enemies prominent Moscow journalist Mikhail Zygar describes opposition leader Alexei Navalny as probably the only real politician in the whole country If Russia had an open political system then Navalny would probably not be alone But because it does not there seems to be no one else crazy enough to trade real life for politics Zygar writes Why does Navalny continue to believe that his time will come and that one day he could succeed Putin as president Theres only one rational explanation hes an alien Party of crooks Zygar wrote tha t in when Navalny was routinely followed harassed threatened and thrown in prison for short spells for leading protests against Putin and what he calls his party of crooks and thieves If Navalnys resolve seemed extraordinary then what to make of it now as he sits once more inside one of Moscows most notorious jails having defied warnings not to return to the country where he was almost murdered last August Navalny was arrested on January upon arrival in Moscow from Germany where he recovered from a nerve agent attack in Siberia that he is certain was carried out by state security on Putins orders Typically he has not gone quietly back behind bars Two days after his arrest his anticorruption fund released an eyepopping report detailing Putins alleged secret ownership of a € billion palace on the Black Sea Despite the Kremlins denials the video has already been viewed more than million times on YouTube Navalny then urged Russians to take to the streets last Saturday not for me but for yourselves for your future and tens of thousands of people in more than towns and cities answered his call His team says protests will resume across the country this Sunday for Navalnys freedom For freedom for all For justice A decade ago Navalny was making a name for himself and making trouble for Russias elite by investigating murky practices in major companies and government procurement and as an informal leader of protests against voterigging in the parliamentary elections But while his ambition was already clear he made no secret of wanting to be president his political philosophy was harder to pin down After growing up in the town of Obninsk south of Moscow Navalny studied law and then joined the liberal Yabloko party It expelled him in for his nationalist activities however and he took part in an annual farright gathering in Moscow called the Russian March Navalny began calling himself a national democrat and while continuing to denounce graft and misrule he also railed against mostly Muslim migrants from the Caucasus and Central Asia in terms that played on the suspicion among many ethnic Russians that they were getting a raw deal in their homeland Some see cynicism others pragmatism in his bid to unite liberal and nationalist opponents of Putin and it is echoed in his current smart voting campaign that encourages people to back whichever politician has the best chance of beating the ruling partys candidate in local and parliamentary elections He has dropped the inflammatory rhetoric as his international profile and domestic standing have grown but still insists he was the right to address sensitive issues that bother millions of Russians even if they discomfit bigcity liberals Yet many people in neighbouring states while longing to see the back of Putin would still be wary of a president Navalny in he wrote in support of Russias war in Georgia and used an ethnic slur to describe its people and while acknowledging that Putin illegally annexed Crimea in he also urged Ukrainians to accept that the peninsula would now stay under his countrys control Arrogant and rude Even Russian activists and journalists who admire Navalny say he can be arrogant and rude But as well as revealing the depth of his determination his emergence from the ordeal of recent months has also softened his image For that and much else he has his wife Yulia to thank She led the campaign to move him to Germany from a Siberian hospital where doctors denied he had even been poisoned and when he woke from a coma he wrote a long post about love on Instagram Yulia you saved me Navalny concluded and let them put that in the neuroscience textbooks She was with him throughout his recuperation and on the flight back to Moscow and kissed him farewell when he was arrested at passport control Leaving the airport without him as a crowd chanted Yulia Yulia she said Alexei is not afraid Im not afraid either and I call on you all not to be afraid The socialmedia savvy Navalny lover of computer games internet memes and US scifi sitcom Rick and Morty appeals to younger Russians in a way Putin never could Navalnys home life with a wife of years and two children appears to be an open book Facing him is a former KGB officer who has never appeared in public with his own two daughters and shrouds his private life and true wealth in secrecy During the pandemic Putin has come to seem more isolated than ever and Navalny now mocks him as the old man in the bunker For many Russians it is not Navalny the politicsobsessed alien with the unshakeable ambition but the increasingly remote Putin who seems to live on a different planet

352,../data/sec_IRL/Irish Times/Factiva-20230807-170,Ireland Relentless crises faced by Macron in first term unlikely to end any time soon Farright and farleft set to campaign hard for upcoming legislative elections Lara Marlowe Wörter April      Emmanuel Macrons Sunday night election victory was summed up by French newspaper headlines A New Start said the proMacron economic daily Les Échos Thanks to whom asked Libération reminding Macron of his debt to its leftwing readers who voted reluctantly for a man they felt had betrayed them Great victory great challenges said the conservative Le Figaro Macrons first term seemed like an interminable crisis The Benalla scandal The yellow vests revolt Transport strikes over pension reform The fire at Notre Dame The beheading of teacher Samuel Paty The pandemic The war in Ukraine Many French find Macrons knowitall air unbearable but they also recognise him as a good crisis manager It is not going to get any easier The war in Ukraine the pandemic and global warming continue with concomitant economic perils In France the street always threatens In his first term effigies of Macron were hanged Brigitte Macrons pained expression at the victory celebration beneath the Eiffel Tower seemed to ask Five more years of hell Source of alarm On the face of it Macrons final score of per cent was a great victory But the fact that million citizens voted for the extreme rightwing candidate Marine Le Pen per cent of votes cast was a source of alarm Even more million registered voters abstained or cast blank or spoiled ballots Macron has clearly failed to fulfil his campaign promise to reenchant politics By the eve of the first round on April Le Pen was polling only or percentage points behind Macron Over the past two weeks the mask of a gentle caring maternal figure which Le Pen had so carefully cultivated fell off Macron zeroed in on Le Pens ties with Vladimir Putin and Viktor Orban the impossibility of financing the gifts she promised voters her unconstitutional plan for a referendum to stop immigration and discriminate against foreigners and her crusade against the Muslim headscarf Thus challenged the new Le Pen turned out to be as unpleasant as the old one Having no more arguments they decided to return to the fundamentals of the Front National the former name of the Rassemblement National that is to say aggressiveness Macron observed on April Le Pen and her farleft counterpart JeanLuc Mélenchon the leader of La France Insoumise the France Unbowed party vowed on Sunday night to lead their troops into what Le Pen called the great electoral battle of the legislative elections seven weeks from now Both came across as surly and vindictive while Macron spoke of benevolence Macron will enjoy no postelection honeymoon with voters The legislative battle takes place amid a complete reconfiguration of French politics The national assembly and the prime ministers job are up for grabs in June They will go to whichever of three blocs achieves the everelusive goal of unity Macrons party La République en Marche may be regarded as an empty vessel which has failed to develop a grassroots presence or as a potential magnet for the decimated Les Républicains and Socialist parties The former LR president Nicolas Sarkozy endorsed Macron instead of his own partys candidate Macrons finance minister Bruno Le Maire a former Les Républicains politician said yesterday that there was no longer any reason why they should not merge with Macrons party The odds of Macron uniting the centre are probably better than those of Le Pen or Mélenchon uniting the extremes Mélenchon hopes to achieve a popular union with the Green party EELV and the Communists by the end of this week But the Socialists want nothing to do with it and the others bridle at Mélenchons myway orthehighway approach The former farrightwing candidate Éric Zemmour has called for a national bloc to unite the farright in the legislative elections but he has so far been shunned by Le Pen Zemmour got his digs in on Sunday night noting that this is the eighth time that defeat has struck the name of Le Pen Unsuccessful elections JeanMarie Le Pen fought five unsuccessful presidential elections His daughter Marine has lost three But the partys score has risen from per cent in to per cent in this election Macron defeated Le Pen by million votes in and by only million votes on Sunday night One cannot help wondering if the election of an extreme rightwing president is somehow inevitable Macron says he will be the president of all the French that he will bring trains schools doctors and public services back to the isolated rural zones which voted en masse for Le Pen No one will be left by the side of the road he said in his victory speech Can this warmer socially minded Macron last Or will liberal economic reforms rekindle the hatred of the French lower classes During their April television debate Macron remarked that he and Le Pen argued less vehemently than five years ago Were getting old Le Pen laughed In a sense the two appear fated to grow old together as president and opponentinchief Le Pen had promised not to stand a fourth time for the presidency Then she said I will not abandon you on Sunday night Term limits will prevent Macron standing again His place in French history may depend on his ability to prevent Le Pen or another farright candidate from becoming his successor 
353,../data/sec_IRL/Irish Times/Factiva-20230807-170,Features Why are some so keen to predict that the end of the world is nigh Western religious thinking tends to assume the history of the world has a beginninga middle and an end with the emphasis on the end Joe Humphreys Wörter April      It feels like were going through a particularly turbulent period of human history what with the pandemic the war in Ukraine the technological upending of human relations and lets not forget climate catastrophe on the horizon It is no surprise then that the Rapture Index yes there is such a thing measuring endoftime activity has hit This according to its evangelical Christian creators is fastenyourseatbelts territory and just two points off an alltimehigh reading from October recorded shortly after the Brexit vote and on the eve of Donald Trumps election as US president Predictions of the end of the world are of course notoriously unreliable One of the most famous was James Usshers forecast that Armageddon would arrive at noon on October exactly years since creation according to the Church of Ireland archbishops calculations But even if you laugh off such cosmic speculation it is tempting to contemplate that the end is nigh Tempting that is if you live in a society immersed in the Abrahamic traditions of the Torah the Bible or the Koran The sense of living close to the end of history is I think a legacy of the western religions says Judith Wolfe an expert in eschatology that branch of human thinking concerned with the end of the world Unlike the eastern religions Judaism Christianity and Islam share a belief in history as a story a narrative arc with a beginning and an end The world was created by a loving God who brings his creative purposes the joy of his creatures to fulfilment even amid human darkness and confusion Important to this world view is that individual human lives and history as a whole are linked both are filled with ambiguity and strife but look forward in hope to salvation and fulfilment both reach that salvation only through judgment and transformation In Hinduism all life goes through birth life death and then rebirth in an endless cycle known as samsara It is a more western bias to place ourselves at the centre of the natural world as though our fortunes determine the ultimate fate of all creation Deeper instinct But is there a deeper psychological instinct at play a human impulse to believe that one is living in exceptional times Whether or not this instinct is universal Wolfe replies its certainly a human impulse to find solid ground to stand on when we feel the ground crumbling around us She adds In times of intellectual social political economic and natural crisis we need ways of making sense of a nonsensical world In such a situation eschatology can give us a framework for sensemaking by making us ask about the last things or ultimate things If we dont ask these questions consciously we tend to reach for the coping strategy of giving ultimate significance to things that arent ultimate much of todays tendency towards radicalisation and nearreligious fervour for often conflicting ideologies is at heart a frantic search for solid ground So thinking about the end of the world is not necessary a negative thing In Christianity it is bound up with the Last Judgment an event that looms over us literally in the case of Michelangelos fresco in the Sistine Chapel to remind us to get our act in order or to prepare for the second coming of Christ Faith in Gods reckoning can lead to some strange views within evangelical circles Days after Russias invasion of Ukraine American televangelist Pat Robertsoncame out of retirement to assert that Russian president Vladimir Putin was acting on a divine plan You can say well Putins out of his mind Yes maybe so Robertson said But at the same time hes being compelled by God And God is getting ready to do something amazing and that will be fulfilled The idea that negative world events are reaching an imminent climax seems to depend on a vengeful God rather than a loving God Does Wolfe agree The end times are often associated with suffering upheaval conflict catastrophe she says This terror is not usually imagined as the result of Gods wrath but as the climax of the human capacity for evil and destruction In fact people often reach for apocalyptic expectations in response to witnessing such horrific destruction that only a God could save us from it Of course apocalyptic expectation also includes expectation of judgment but that is often a matter of hope as much as fear a matter of faith that however much evil may prevail unpunished in the world there will at the last be justice for the oppressed and release for the abused Capacity for destruction Wolfe is one of a number of leading theologians and metaphysicians who are gathering in Maynooth this week to debate the future of Christian thinking at a threeday conference Organiser Philip Gonzales of St Patricks Pontifical University says If history has taught us anything it is our unimaginable capacity for destruction and violence along with our desire for power and mastery The Christian apocalypse beckons us to acknowledge and move away from this dark reality of the human heart Whatever existential threats exist God is love and inherently nonviolent according to Gonzales But does eschatology have any real place in a scientifically literate society We dont need to consult the Book of Revelation when we have climate scientists telling us what factually awaits us if we fail to tackle global warming And in the longer term the consensus among cosmologists is that the universe will keep expanding for trillions of years until it ends in a big rip a big crunch or some other weird event Can Christian eschatology be married with such scientific forecasts or is it a case of having to choose one or the other Humans now have in their power possibilities of destruction that were in the past restricted entirely to literary or religious fantasy says Wolfe More than ever we feel like Goethes Sorcerers Apprentice that we have unleashed dark powers which we can no longer reliably control or restrain In this situation more than ever we face the question whether this is it whether if total destruction really comes there is anything to hope for Religion doesnt or shouldnt be a substitute for personal and corporate responsibility it shouldnt lull people into inaction or wishful thinking The biblical authors see humans as having responsibility for the Earth as being accountable for their stewardship to God himself But religion does open a horizon of hope a faith that our own greed and destruction are not the deepest truth about the world or about our lives that Gods good purposes run deeper Prof Judith Wolfe is among the speakers at The Future of Christian Thinking conference at St Patricks Pontifical University in Maynooth on April See maynoothcollegeie

trauma and family as the International Literature Festival Dublin celebrates its birthday Martin Colthorpe Wörter Mai      In a big year for literary anniversaries in Ireland marks the birthday of International Literature Festival Dublin We may only be a quarter of the age of Ulysses and as a festival were still a whippersnapper compared to Listowel Writers Week years young but when we launched in the landscape for books in Ireland was nevertheless a very different place There was no Irish Laureate for Fiction no One City One Book promotion Dublin had not been decreed a Unesco City of Literature and Sally Rooney was only seven years old The past quarter century has seen books take centre stage as a public artform in ways difficult to imagine a generation ago Our strapline is Years of Stories and feels like a pivotal year for the festival Were returning to public stages after a twoyear absence and taking up residence in our new festival village in Merrion Square For the first time were creating a hub where all our events take place Where friends and families can spend the day across a huge range of events and dropin activities Were turning over a new leaf in what will be an exciting new chapter for the festival And yet we celebrate this anniversary against the uneasy backdrop of real history being made on the borders of Europe And while the conflict in Ukraine feels too raw and immediate too complex to grapple with through public debate we know that its manifestations the destruction of cities the displacement of peoples the shifting of territories and the loss of loved ones are the human stories that artists will wrestle with for decades to come in direct and sometimes more oblique ways As the horrors unfold how will the writers of the future tell the story of whats happening now in Mariupol in Kyiv in the Donbas The stories brought to the festival this year by an international array of writers provide some important clues Through what lens do they reflect on past traumas What tone do they adopt to describe the indescribable How do they sift stories through their own lives and the lives of their families Before he became a writer Joseph Conrad born in Ukraine in travelled the world as a merchant marine He bore witness to the excesses of imperialism and colonialism but saw his writing in stark terms My task which I am trying to achieve is by the power of the written word to make you hear to make you feel it is before all to make you see Soldiers and raids With Conrads maxim in mind discovering the work of FrenchRwandan author Scholastique Mukasonga has been a revelation and no author in the festival better reflects writing out of trauma Mukasonga left Rwanda in and her memoir The Barefoot Woman is peppered with flashbacks of soldiers raiding her family home In the civil war of members of her family were killed It took Mukasonga years to find the courage to return to Rwanda and through doing so she found the courage to begin her journey as a writer Were honoured to be partnering with Trinity College Dublins Centre for Resistance Studies in bringing Scholastique to the festival Lana Bastašic grew up in Bosnia in the midst of war and this year marks the anniversary of the siege of Sarajevo Writing her debut novel Catch the Rabbit became an act of physical and psychological return voiced through childhood friends the Serbian Sara and Muslim Lejla who reunite to search for Armin who is missing presumed dead during the war Bastašic will be in conversation with Priscilla Morris whose father bought a flak jacket and went to Sarajevo to rescue her maternal grandparents Her home in London filled with refugee relatives and her debut novel Black Butterflies draws on these experiences with their echoes of the conflict in Ukraine in its depiction of life behind the barricades Faïza Guène is a writer whose dispatches from the Parisian banlieues have helped bring peripheral voices to the centre of French literature Her new novel Discretion published in May marks the anniversary of the FrancoAlgerian war and beautifully reflects how these epochal historical moments echo down the years through the stories of women through the experiences of second generation immigrants and through feelings of allegiance to a country which is at once home and not Poetry and resistance We close our festival with a celebration of the work of Eavan Boland and Thomas Kinsella both of whom were lost to Irish literature during the pandemic Our event Pillars of a City will reflect on the power of their poetry and their enormous legacy And Kinsella too reminds us that sometimes political resistance happens much closer to home His poem Butchers Dozen was written as a direct response to the Widgery Report which whitewashed the atrocities of Bloody Sunday It was published on April with the poet himself saying that The Widgery report was a great insult My response was instant the poem itself was written and issued in seven days Butchers Dozen is published in a new edition this year to mark its anniversary alongside a prologue from the Saville Report an epilogue from the British prime ministers House of Commons apology and a new authors note It shows that poems can offer both an immediate dispatch but also become part of the historical conversation for decades to come Great writing both responds to history and also helps to shape it And so our mind turns to Merrion Square later in May After a period of restriction and limited horizons it feels exciting to welcome the worlds writers back to Dublin We feature authors from Japan Nigeria and Angola from the US and Europe and of course from across Ireland There will be readings and talks Therell be workshops yoga running and walks Well be building on the success of our online festival editions in and and livestreaming events to audiences across Ireland and around the world But its the return to public spaces echoing Conrad that gives us that wonderful opportunity to properly hear and feel and see the world again And I cant think of a better environment to hear the worlds stories than at a literary festival in the company of fellow readers and writers in the company of fellow storytellers Martin Colthorpe is programme director of International Literature Festival Dublin which runs from Thursday May to Sunday May in Merrion Square Park To

the end of an era The Monday night talking shop has only been around since and never quite registered as essential viewing But the series has nonetheless proudly carried on that strange tradition of Irish currentaffairs programming that lurches towards the surreal and bonkers An item on recycling bins that left you more confused at the end than at the start Byrne in her shed early in the pandemic the star of her own foundfootage horror movie A segment in which she received a flu jab in her car from former TD Kate OConnell This was Irish broadcasting at its most wigged out with Byrne at the centre of the pandemonium as TVs ultimate straight woman The final episode is alas short on memeworthy highlights Having announced out of the blue last week she was stepping down to focus on her morning radio show for her big farewell Byrne just gets on with things It is Claire Byrne Going Through The Motions slightly First up is a report on the weekend chaos at Dublin Airport A woman in the US explains how her husband had been left to fend for himself when hours of queuing triggered an epileptic fit A pregnant passenger describes being stopped for spot checks as she dashed for her flight Everybody around me was running crying panicking she says When you got past the shops there were two people spotchecking and swabbing more people I saw them stopping people as they were running Then it is on to a segment about homophobic abuse in Dublin Weve all been patting ourselves on the backs since the Marriage Equality referendum However wrenching testimonies by DJ Stephen Byrne and rugby player Evan Somers confirm homophobia is alive and stalking the streets of central Dublin It was on OConnell Bridge recollects Byrne I heard that slur I was on the floor blood all over As its the final episode Byrne and her team make a small concession to posterity with a closing item in which she reflects on the upheavals of the past seven years with a panel These have been unrelentingly interesting times says columnist Alison OConnor Marriage equality is great at the same time it didnt make much of a difference to those two guys says campaigner Martin Beanz Warde referencing the earlier item on homophobic abuse That does bring us to the end says Byrne finally It has been an honour to be with you to see really challenging times for our country And then the credits roll and its the close of an interesting sometimes bizarre chapter in Irish current affairs broadcasting Whatever RTÉ plans for the slot next it will have its work cut out reaching the absurd heights to which Claire Byrne Live often ascended Cosy detective With her knowing smile and whiff of headgirl mischievousness Lucy Worsley has the air of a detective from a cosy costume drama Something set in and featuring a vicar murdered on the croquet lawn And in Lucy Worsley Investigates BBC Two Tuesday the BBC had given the hyperenthusiastic historian the perfect vehicle for her sleuthing talents In part one she explored the misogyny behind the witchburning epidemic of the Puritan era And for the second of four episodes its further back in time several centuries to the and the Black Death This is of course a grisly topic with the population of Britain reduced during that time from around six million to an estimated three million Worsley does not make light of the suffering Nonetheless she approaches the subject with a sense of derringdo Her excitement as she delves into the archives has a well infectiousness probably isnt the best way of putting it given the context but goodness she

parallels She instead goes full sleuth as she delves into the archives at the wonderfully named Suffolk village Walsham the Willows One surprise is that rather than encouraging the populace to abandon their faith the Black Death had the opposite impact Religion was something to cling to as England became hell on earth and there was an upsurge in pilgrimages to holy sites such as Canterbury Cathedral Ghoulish though it may sound there were upsides too to half the population perishing in the pestilence When the apocalypse was over labour shortages allowed the great unwashed to command higher wages If I were at the peasant level of society ironically the Black Death might be good for me if I survived says Worsley The Black Death also created new opportunities for women There are lots of examples of women inheriting land from men says Worsley Womens names are appearing in the records For the first time they are economically relevant Worsley doesnt go so far as to wrap up the episode in a big happy bow But this is a nuanced exploration of a great calamity — and a showcase for the presenters ability to bring the past engagingly to life Blinking lights English villages can

new novel Factory Girls Wörter Juni      In June Id just finished my first year exams in Trinity College Dublin Many of my peers were jetting off to the USA on visas But my parents helped me pack my books bedding clothes and CDs into their car before driving me back to the North We were stopped at the Border crossing in Aughnacloy where Aidan McAnespie had been shot dead in by a soldier who claimed that his finger slipped on the trigger of his weapon A soldier diverted our car off the road and into a large shed My father was instructed to drive our car onto a ramp over a void so soldiers could inspect the undercarriage Then he was told to park further down in the search facility and we were ordered out of the car As the soldiers took my possessions out of the car and picked meticulously through them we adopted a familiar stance blank faces reluctant cooperation doing our best not to antagonise the armed fellas in uniform After we were released we drove home and I spent a gruesomely long summer in Tyrone Although Id advertised my IT typing and babysitting skills widely I had zero job offers I knocked around at home trying to avoid hearing Love is All Around on the radio reading books and magazines obsessing over Riverdance and the newly opened Channel Tunnel cheering Ireland on in the World Cup and numbly watching a series of murder reports as peace talks ground slowly on behind the scenes When the IRA announced their first ceasefire at the end of August friends and relatives from England Ireland and the US wrote and rang offering congratulations But where they saw Peace At Last I could only see a temporary cessation of hostilities Eighteen years of living in the north had not taught me to hope or trust I grew up in Castlederg a small border town that for a few decades was infamous for being the most bombed small town in western Europe after the second World War When I lived there the population was almost evenly balanced between Catholics and Protestants But the town was so deeply segregated that I first met a Protestant my own age when I was selected to participate in a crosscommunity quiz at the age of years old I was introduced to my Protestant counterparts by armed police officers in the back of a bulletandblastproofed police car Encounters like this continued until I left school adults sporadically threw Protestant and Catholic teens into close contact on residential weekends or trips abroad expecting us to form bonds strong enough to neutralise the effects of the separate schools churches shops and housing estates that previous generations had designed for us These trips didnt result in longlasting crosscommunity friendships for me I spent the summer of hanging out with my childhood friends and our relatives in a social circle of Catholics that no crosscommunity initiative had breached for centuries I loved being at home I hated being at home When I learned that Id passed my first year exams and could return to Dublin I felt relief I could leave home all over again But the following summer bruised by my second year in Trinity I returned to Tyrone The IRA ceasefire was holding and the subsequent ceasefire called by the Combined Loyalist Military Command was also in place But there was still a sense among the people I knew that this was not peace At least not what wed dreamed of Guns had been laid down and there was talk about decommissioning but this was the summer that Gerry Adams remarked the IRA havent gone away you know Oh we knew We all knew But I hoped the summer of would be different to the ceasefire had reduced the murder rate and my best friends had swung me a job interview in the shirt factory where they worked I sweated my way through an interview with the boss well aware that my knowledge of AngloSaxon poetry and medieval literature wasnt going to get me far But he hired me I earned the princely sum of £ in return for working four days a week I had to iron shirts an hour to hit my basic rate after that I got a bonus for every extra shirt I pressed The set up sounds hideously exploitative now but this job allowed me to taste the freedom that comes from having a small disposable income I went to the pub bought clothes bus tickets and books without borrowing money Yet I still felt trapped I had no car It would be years before mobile phones and the internet would penetrate our community The house I lived in was crammed with my parents and five siblings and our possessions worries dreams and obsessions My peer group amounted to about people I was related to some of them and had little in common with most Castlederg was so small that it was impossible to avoid the people you knew when shopping or socialising but when I started in the factory I realised that despite years of crosscommunity activities Id never met most people from the other side of the town they went to different schools pubs and churches Now I was thrown into a neutral workplace with the Protestants Id lived sidebyside with yet apart from and we had to work together to manufacture shirts It was the twilight of the British textile industry we knew well the sight of Derrys worldfamous shirt factories standing dead as tombstones along the Foyle We understood we were working in the shadow of supermodern Asian factories with cheap labour and less rigorous employment rules So we put most of our small differences aside to earn money have a bit of craic and get on with our wee lives As a freshly minted university graduate I proudly listed my factory job on my CV But at my first interview I was advised to remove the embarrassing factory stint from my CV my potential employer deemed unemployment preferable to the factory job that had taught me much more about teamwork optimisation negotiation bullying tribalism sexism and capitalism than the summer Id spent photocopying and filing in a genteel Dublin publishing office I resentfully deleted my factory job from my CV But I couldnt erase it from my brain Eight years later I wrote my first novel Big Girl Small Town while living in the North steeped in the atmosphere and accents of our community years after the Ceasefire I tried to capture the feeling of abandonment I was drowning in generations used to conflict and media attention left alone to get on with the unglamorous difficult business of conflict resolution and healing But when I started writing Factory Girls in my life was very different I was living in London watching the UK tear itself apart over the Brexit campaign Though I was still in touch with my school friends my social circle included people from all over the world I was atheist and had married a FrenchMoroccan from a Catholic Muslim background Our sons were unbaptised a fact that meant we were struggling to secure Irish school places as both Catholic and Protestant schools prioritised Christian applications Somehow these conditions encouraged the character Maeve Murray to march into my brain and I used my factory experience and the terrible but ultimately hopeful summer of as a backdrop for Factory Girls Its a darkly funny story about three friends working in a factory to save money so they can escape from their deadend town messy love lives and the Troubles But after moving to Dublin I ran out of maternity leave and writing energy I reluctantly shelved Factory Girls until when the Arts Council awarded me the financial support I needed to put my tech career on hold Writing conditions were far from ideal Covid had taken hold and Brexit had dragged the Irish border back into the headlines and I worried for my family and friends up North and fretted over the possibility of a hard border I was homeschooling two children who were isolated from their family and friends For months my only company was the characters Id created in Factory Girls and my husband and kids who accused me of speaking like Nana when I resurfaced each day after hours of writing It was not easy to dive back into the atmosphere of those summers I spent in Tyrone during a pandemic while trauma and death were once again in the headlines I found it hard to revisit the violence of those days before the ceasefires whose consequences such as the ongoing trial of the soldier who shot Aidan McAnespie are never far from the surface of my life Given the times it feels like a bit of a feat to have written a book that has been described as seriously funny Tyrone might not yet be a tourist hotspot but my hometown is a much more colourful cheerful place now with residents and restaurants from various countries and cultures Trip Advisor recommends visiting attractions like the castle ruins pine forests the holy well and local library But what lures me back home time and again apart from the chippers we have such good chippers is the wit and resilience of the tough but kind people I grew up around Factory Girls is published by John Murray

show time in Oberammergau a pretty village of extravagantly painted houses tucked into the Bavarian Alps Every decade for nearly years the crowds have come here to watch the village stage the passion play and today is no different with visitors from Florida the Philippines and just down the road in Garmisch Weve never been as were not really churchgoers said Viktor a local alongside his wife Friends offered us tickets and we decided to come but its more for the theatre than out of any religious conviction Inside the vast festival theatre the seats are filling up in the covered auditorium when as if on cue the sky behind the stage darkens A roll of thunder is followed by a flash of lightning and a heavy Alpine downpour Jesus rides onstage on a donkey cheered by followers waving palm leaves beginning an overwhelming feast for the eyes and ears a Cecil B DeMillesized cast of six goats two camels two horses a choir of and musicians in the pit offering a lush Haydnlike musical palette Catholic heartland Over the next five hours of performance broken up by a threehour dinner break a familiar drama will unfold But each decade Oberammergaus amateur passion players take a different route to Golgotha This year their journey is coloured by the twoyear pandemic delay war in Europe and lingering fury towards bishops in what was once a traditional Catholic heartland Six months ago the Bavarian archdiocese of Munich and Freising presented a report revealing at least cases of clerical sexual abuse in the postwar era Some relate to emeritus Pope Benedict XVIs time as archbishop of Munich though he denies any knowledge of or responsibility for abuse or abusing priests Oberammergau artistic director Christian Stückl remembers how when he took over in the local Catholic Church still had what he calls a were the boss arrogance towards the play and its theological content reflecting the exalted position the institution enjoyed in daily life Like in Ireland though the change towards the church here is astonishing he said When the clerical abuse report came out in January he and his creative team wondered if they really wanted to hold a traditional opening Mass for this years passion play We went ahead with it in the end after they said to us You cant abandon us too he said But people have given up on the church here From its beginning in the passion play staged every decade by villagers in thanks for being spared the plague has been a tugofwar twice over between liberal and conservative villagers and between locals and Bavarian bishops who muscled in Stückl has led the lay reformist pushback since stripping the script of antiSemitism dropping historical bans on married women appearing and allowing Protestant and Muslim villagers onstage In a sign of the times is the firstever production where none of the main performers are churchgoers In one way its immaterial the story we are telling says Stückl a celebrated German theatre director On the other hand though its impossible to get around the material and the larger their role the more the performers are forced to engage with and discuss this story these teachings This years script places Jesuss revolutionary teachings and political arguments at the heart of the play placing many of Jesuss most familiar gospel teachings in the mouths of his followers The result Jesuss famed Sermon on the Mount is not topdown revelation but a crowdsourced human reaction to the injustices of the time and the belief in something better The high priests Oberammergaus Jesus in is angry towards the high priests delivering a blunt message that is as applicable today Anyone more interested in privilege and position than their core message anyone who preaches rather than lives the gospels need not worry about being sidelined by secularism they have sidelined themselves At a bleak time for Christianity in Europe this unflinching Oberammergau message feels curiously optimistic the human hope for salvation never dies just those who take this hope hostage Staging such a play is a massive undertaking onethird of this village of is directly involved and hotels and restaurants live off the playgoers who come from May to October But what of the future The pandemic cancellation of has meant not all guests have returned and unusually tickets are still available for most performances until October Oberammergaus audience profile is old and getting older And when visitors disappear into the theatre the pretty streets of Oberammergau resemble a Potemkin village Local wood carvers continue to sell traditional wooden religious designs unchanged in a century but few are buying The ship has sailed on our woodcarver tradition says one older shop owner sadly Any younger talents are now working in the theatre or in Berlin Sharing that gloomy outlook is Benedikt Fisher He sits before his bright and cheery Theatre Cafe the last caffeination point before the performance as he gets ready for his camp scenestealing turn as King Herod Like all locals the year old has a huge emotional connection to the passion play After wrestling back its control from the bishops though he would like a radical overhaul of Oberammergau both play and village to ensure its best years arent behind it The passion play is like a golden calf we worship every years he says It absorbs all our energy and innovation potential and sometimes I worry that it destroys and hinders more than it creates

August      It is in the port of Cartagena and the Jouri a livestock carrier is getting ready for loading Dozens of trucks full of noisy cattle line up waiting for their animals to be weighed before they are transferred to the vessel The tourists who visit its Roman ruins and nearby beaches might never guess that this region has quietly become one of the biggest players in the global trade of live animals The past month has seen a peak in exports driven by demand for animals to slaughter for Eid alAdha the festival of sacrifice which took place in July this year and is celebrated throughout the Muslim world A boom in exports from Spain over the past decade has seen it now establish itself as the largest exporter of cattle by sea in Europe and second largest exporter of sheep after Romania More than three million farm animals have been sent out on ships from Cartagenas port in the past five years mostly to the Middle East and north Africa in a trade worth almost € million to Spain in Animal welfare A tightening of animal welfare rules by another leading exporter of farm animals Australia has been a big boost for Spain The new rules include requirements for details on the conditions animals will be slaughtered in once they arrive at destination countries Since the new rules were introduced in Australia has stopped trading with Saudi Arabia and Libya with both counties now a top destinations for sheep and cattle from Spain along with Lebanon and Jordan Usually within a market if someone pulls out someone else comes in to fill the void and Spain was willing to do that says Olga Kikou European Affairs Manager at Compassion in World Farming an organisation campaigning for stronger EU regulations on farmed animal welfare Spain is also the perfect place to fatten animals say animal welfare campaigners who point to the comparatively low cost of feed and large amount of space available for animals Many of the cattle are male calves unwanted by the dairy industry and sent to Spain from across Europe Along with Tarragona another Spanish port to the north Cartagena is the only facility in Spain with permits to consign live animals by sea Last year close to animals were exported from Cartagena and a total of from the whole of Spain Not that anyone in the city itself would know Trucks from farms across Spain bring the animals directly to an area of the port closed off to the public Only when trucks arrive after the ports closure and drivers have to wait at a nearby petrol station does the noise of the animals give a hint to outsiders Animal welfare activists use superzoom lenses to look for evidence of violations of EU rules These include wounds bad conditions inside the trucks and cruelty to animals when they are loaded Most people wouldnt even understand why we are putting a goat a sheep a pig or cattle on a long transport It just doesnt make sense Its the unnecessary cruelty which will sooner or later be the end of this industry says Gabriel Paun director of Animals International Although vets check the animals before they board conditions onboard remain largely unknown with only Australia releasing mortality figures for what are often multipleday journeys Activists are calling for the mandatory presence of a vet on vessels to be included in new EU legislation expected by the end of Last year almost cattle exported from Spain on two separate vessels died within two weeks The Karim Allah and the Elbeik were stranded after being refused entry into Middle East ports because of suspected cases of the animal disease bluetongue The Karim Allah had departed from Cartagena with cows onboard and was refused entry into several ports in Turkey Libya and Tunisia After a twomonthlong journey it returned to Cartagena During the journey animals died The others were declared unfit and euthanised in early March The Elbeik with animals onboard suffered the same fate When it returned to port in Spain animals were already dead The remaining animals were also declared unfit and euthanised The official report for the Elbeik seen by the Guardian describes a lack of water and food for the animals with malfunctioning feeding systems overcrowding of some parts of the vessel breaking maximum density rules and overall neglect of animal welfare by the crew The captain also confessed to Spanish authorities that at least cattle were chopped up and thrown overboard into the Mediterranean Activists continue to lobby for an outright EU ban on the live animal trade and its replacement with frozen meat exports Some Spanish politicians agree María Marín a member of the regional parliament in Murcia says her Unidas Podemos party will propose regulations to forbid the trade of livestock to third countries and replace it with meat trade of animals slaughtered in Europe following European regulations Widespread political support for such a ban in Spain remains unlikely says Spains animal rights party the Party Against Mistreatment of Animals Spain is an industrial farm that makes a high contribution to the economy of the country and private companies It was actually one of the few sectors that grew during the pandemic it said in a written answer A starting point would be greater transparency argues Guillermo Díaz a national MP from the liberal party Ciudadanos As long as the citizens dont have information on this trade there will be no pressure against it he says If people knew how these animals are raised and transported they would turn against it Guardian

and abilities Wörter September      Its my serve says Willie Treacy Across the court his opponent rallies the wiffle ball back to him In Cabra Parkside Community Sports Centre there are about to people playing pickleball on this Wednesday evening Some of Willies opponents are up to years younger than him Pickleball in its infancy in Ireland unites different ages genders and abilities to compete against and play with each other Like a mixture of tennis tabletennis and badminton pickleball is played in doubles on a badminton court each player holding a paddle and hitting the ball over a net Unlike tennis the net is lower the court is smaller and the rules differ Unlike tennis which takes time to master rallies can and do begin in your first pickleball session The rules can be tricky for beginners but we took to it very quickly says Treacy Its a great game you get exercise and its fun which is essential We play for roughly around an hour and it passes really quickly because were having so much fun Pickleball was introduced to Ireland in by Michael McDaid who founded Pickleball Ireland The pandemic abruptly put an end to pickleballs progression but in Pickleball Ireland was incorporated as a nonprofit entity The game involves running back and forth to ensure the ball goes over the net but its accessible in a way that tennis and badminton are not Im years of age and its easy you just get into the game you get a good run good exercise a good workout without the gym Its really a winwin all round The game is massively popular in the United States with professional players pickleball influencers and even its own magazine InPickleball But for Stephanie Barman who moved from Salt Lake City Utah to Ireland nine years ago she only heard about it from her mom when she went home for Christmas in December My mum is like mad into it and shes She was like Stephanie You gotta come play pickleball So she roped us into it and before we left we bought some paddles on Amazon and yeah we were just like how are we going to play this When she returned to Ireland she sought out clubs in Dublin Fitness I was actively looking for pickleball clubs because I had so much fun Its an easy game to pick up and any age can play it doesnt really matter your fitness level you can play with kids or adults like I played with my little cousin before and its just great craic If youre willing to get out and have a little fun youll be grand You swap partners so you can always be with different levels of competition and as youre swapping if you just take on one new thing every time youll learn something People who played tennis or anything with handeye coordination theyll pick it up so easy You see some people with certain shots and theyre just whacking them and some of them theyd run and its like theres no way theyre gonna get it and some do Any age can do it for sure PIckleball is part of Dublin City Councils Dublin Citys Sports and Wellbeing Partnership says Michelle Waters a sports development officer with the council When Waters started pickleball as part of her role it was with older adults some people in their that continues on Mondays with the older adult group The sport is for everyone though the emphasis being on getting people moving says Waters Weve dabbled with primary school kids in the local area weve recently had North Dublin Muslim School who came down for their active school week They came into the hall did three classes and got an intro to pickleball Its a very versatile sport dynamic great for fit people but also for older adults Come September were hoping to bring in a disability service The difficulty is to get people to venture into the hall to try but once theyre in theyre hooked Ive been noticing for weeks I can see the difference in skill levels its brilliant The jump in skill level also stands out to Barman Some of those people I brought two girls for the first time are so good its such an easy sport to get someone new into theyve all been playing for weeks and look how good they are The Dublin City Council partnership has invested in pickleball in Cabra so admission is free Other centres charge nominal fees to play and all centres provide the paddles balls and nets Were trying to get it in other areas get other sports officers involved Its great you can have young old mixed genders its brilliant Hopefully itll go from strength to strength says Waters For Barman shed like to see the game grow in tandem with increased access Facilities Its just about facilities an easy thing Dublin City Council could do is lining courts in public Public parks if they had the lines for pickleball it would start getting people interested You dont necessarily need the net to be at the right height its just about ya know if you have the line So we set our markers and just like that but at least its like thats the start of it Pickleball Ireland are planning a oneday festival in October this year and are looking to host a Pickleball Open with US and European competitors in June For Treacy this is all good news I would hope that we would get good enough to progress and play in some competitive games maybe with other clubs Its an American game thered be great interest in intercountry games ya know Maybe international games All depends on how well we progress thatll be for the younger people coming up Theyre really good and theyre really competitive for us and for the group that were in now its just terrific

379,../data/sec_IRL/Irish Times/Factiva-20230807-170,Ireland Controversy in the Church of Ireland as Dublin archbishop loses some powers Synod of the dioceses of Dublin and Wicklow voted for major changes Wörter Oktober      Relations between bishops and their flocks are rarely all sweetness and light but what took place this week between Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin and Glendalough Michael Jackson and members of his two united dioceses is without precedent Late on Tuesday night at the annual synod of the dioceses in Taney Hall in Dundrum the first such inperson meeting since the pandemic a number of executive powers held by the archbishop were removed from him in consecutive votes Putatively about compliance with updated charities legislation and despite opposition from senior clergy the consecutive votes taken by shows of hands were overseen without comment by the Archbishop himself in the chair Under the changes the membership of the synods in each diocese that in turn sent forward members to the dioceses Diocesan Councils will be reduced by per cent with the Archbishop no longer in the chair of some of them Under the changes the membership of the dioceses two Diocesan Councils one representing Dublin and other the smaller Wicklow will be reduced by per cent while the councils will also be in charge of all financial and business matters Opposing the changes Archdeacon of Dublin David Pierpoint an ally of the Archbishop said his understanding was that the two dioceses are already compliant with charity regulations and good governance The changes he said have the effect of removing much authority from the office of Archbishop which as an office it always had I dont believe its right certainly it does not foster good relationships within these dioceses He added I believe the office of Archbishop is being slightly sidelined In opposition too Dermot Dunne Dean of Dublins Christ Church Cathedral felt the matter was very serious and that it had come from dysfunctional councils that havent worked or cooperated together over the last number of sessions Ive been hearing it all over the diocese he declared to the meeting In his view it was trying to take powers away from the Archbishop or the office of Archbishop that are rightly belonging to the office of Archbishop Rector of Taney parish Rev Nigel Pierpoint brother of Archdeacon Pierpoint said It seems to be an issue of power struggle Im sorry to have to say it that but thats the way it seems that there is a power struggle going on In every area His Grace Archbishop Jackson is kindly pushed to the side except in ministry declared the archdeacon to the meeting adding I appeal to you once again please please lets not go down this road or accept this Bill Rev Prof Anne Lodge a parttime minister and the director of the Church of Ireland Centre at the Dublin City University Institute of Education also spoke against the Bill Despite such opposition the changes were passed comfortably Archbishop Jackson is not unused to controversy Elected in the Co Fermanagh native ruffled feathers in October when he spoke of his deep and shattering sadness to find sectarianism among his flock in Dublin and Wicklow I did not have the luxury of a childhood where I was able to dismiss sectarianism as the sort of thing those dreadful Northerners get up to a phrase I have heard more than once trip off the tongue in these united dioceses he declared then Describing himself as one of those dreadful Northerners he went on in a longremembered phrase to criticise Church members who described newcomers as polyester Protestants It did not go down well There was tension in when he and Lodge then principal at the Church of Ireland College of Education in Rathmines oversaw its controversial transfer to a new DCU campus at St Patricks College in Drumcondra severing a year link with Trinity College However what escalated ongoing tensions to an epic scale more recently began as a local row over the future of the St George and St Thomas parish in Dublins city centre beginning with a Facebook post on March last year In that post parishioners and the select vestry of St George and St Thomas said they were shocked and dismayed about the condition their church had been allowed to fall into despite pledges from diocesan authorities including the Archbishop Our parish has been sorely neglected they said painting a picture of homeless people sleeping in the porch and tents and piles of rubbish left outside the building on Cathal Brugha Street in the north inner city The church had become a most public and visible example of profane use and vandalism with the porch a wellknown public space for drug dealing and consumption illegal dumping it is even used as a most grotesque outdoor human toilet they complained Pledges The administration of St George and St Thomas had been passed over to the Dublin and Glendalough archdiocese in they said and they had been confident with the pledges given then that it would be maintained and given a new life That Facebook post on March coincided with a Zoom meeting of the two diocesan councils in Dublin and Glendalough chaired by Archbishop Jackson but it was at a subsequent meeting on March when he addressed it in a furious response By then relations between him and the two diocesan councils of Dublin and Glendalough with their combined members of whom are clergy were at rock bottom The relationship has been deteriorating for years Jackson did not hold back saying twice for effect I am ashamed of these diocesan councils I am ashamed of these diocesan councils He went on I am ashamed of the ways in which the last meeting of the diocesan councils careered from the very outset into an agenda of its own In his address a copy of which has been seen by  Archbishop Jackson said he was embarrassed at how some members of the councils treated diocesan staff It could rightly be recognised and dealt with as bullying and harassment he claimed Some members had sought to take to themselves a position of high standing and unexaminable influence he said adding that such a sense of selfentitlement was distasteful and destructive of dignity and trust and amounted to atrocious behaviour There had also been a constant insinuation that the Church of Ireland is not in compliance with charities regulation he said when the reality of that situation is that there have been unending conversations about such matters There was no evidence of failure of governance and that had been verified he claimed but there was evidence of concerted repeated escalating actions that are designed to shatter the sense of a happy diocese he said It has to stop Turning to the March St George and St Thomas statement he said he was ashamed of members of councils who mocked the good work at St George and St Thomas which was literally rubbished at the March meeting The Facebook post depicted the city centre church in such a way as to blame the diocese for not keeping it clean and tidy had mocked homeless people as a focus of ridicule and that it was an affront to middleclass respectability Church volunteers had repeatedly with their own hands tidied and cleared away the needles the faeces the rubbish in that forecourt only to be ridiculed on Facebook he charged questioning the source of some of the rubbish dumped at the church The Facebook post had been introduced to the meeting on March in a spectacular orchestration that pointed dangerously to politicking and had left Jackson with a sense of intense sadness and of fundamental alarm as well as genuine bewilderment he said Quoting from Scripture he said the story of the evil very evil Jezebel offered a cautionary tale to everyone about how evil desires corrupt individuals and destroys them warning that where dogs licked the blood of Naboth whom Jezebel had executed there dogs will lick your blood Faced with calls for a copy of the address Archbishop Jackson three months later said a hard copy would be added to the September minutes Otherwise it could be read in prebooked slots on dates in June and July in the Rathmines diocesan office He said that it may not be photographed photocopied or recorded on any medium or on any device nor may its contents be used outside the confidentiality to which members of the diocesan councils are bound The content of the speech may not be used for any extraneous purpose Mediation A copy had been lodged too with Church of Ireland Primate Archbishop of Armagh John McDowell who was free to share it as appropriate said Jackson who then absented himself from further diocesan council while mediation was under way Not surprisingly the Archbishops Zoom speech provoked consternation amongst his audience However extraordinarily and due to the rules of strict confidentiality that exist within the Church of Ireland it remained private until this week Members of the diocesan councils who spoke to  on condition of anonymity expressed deep shock I was stunned at its content and the manner of delivery He didnt even begin with the usual prayer It has us reeling He maligned people and vilified a number of individuals said one member In instances this amounted to personal assassination Indicating the level of bitterness this person said he has found it difficult to pray for the man I pray for the office instead A second member spoke of the shock they had felt I asked myself Is this what I am really hearing I was very upset A third member said I was surprised and very hurt Sitting alone at home I felt abused by the comments some of which could have applied to me personally I know that many of my councils colleagues were equally shocked and offended This person added that they felt let down by a senior person in the church which I love and from which I expect to receive respect along with support and comfort Following mediation led by Archbishop Primate John McDowell after complaints were made Archbishop Jackson read out a statement at a diocesan councils meeting last December where he said he regretted if anyone had felt angry or was hurt by his comments He went on to say that he was supporting a process of wideranging review the purpose of which is to lead to changes and improvements in how the archdiocese managed its affairs and he urged others to do likewise In June last year advice was sought from a senior counsel on the Church of Irelands legal position regarding updated charities legislation which led to the changes presented to the Taney Hall meeting last Tuesday Proposer Robert Neill said the measures followed the legal advice given in June to the diocesan councils on compliance with charities law The United Dioceses of Dublin and Glendalough is a registered charity What we have been operating to date in diocesan councils does not really work in accordance with the Governments legislation he said Seconder Rev William Olhausen rector of Killiney said it was an attempt to comply with the Charities Act in the best way we can In votes Jackson was roundly defeated So what happens now Clearly he is in a very difficult position and may resign as he could have done last year when he passed the retirement age for the archbishopic post though he shows no desire to do so Responding to queries a spokeswoman for the Archbishop said the Taney Hall measures would enable the diocesan councils to meet the six principles of governance including working effectively and being accountable and transparent as required by charities legislation She continued As you will have heard on Tuesday evening both the proposer and the seconder of the Bill stated during the debate that their focus was on good governance and compliance with charities regulation on the part of Diocesan Councils

381,../data/sec_IRL/Irish Times/Factiva-20230807-170,Features Surgery Element of catchup affecting the whole country post pandemic Surgeons Deborah McNamara and Kevin Barry offer insight into how hospitals can deal with backlogs in surgery in the context of Covid Wörter Oktober      Since midJuly Prof Kevin Barry is back working to a full schedule of surgery My weekly timetable is not hampered by Covid now but there is an element of catchup which is affecting the whole of the country and we dont know what will happen this winter with flu and Covid says Prof Barry consultant general surgeon at Mayo University Hospital and Galway University Hospital Virtual outpatient clinics where patients speak to their consultant on the phone rather than go to the hospital targeted weekend waiting list initiatives for endoscopic surgery investigative procedures for stomach and bowel conditions and weekend symptomatic breast outpatients clinics are some of the ways surgeons are trying to make up ground lost during the Covid pandemic The backlog in surgeries for hip and knee replacements and other routine surgeries following the pandemic has emphasised more than ever the importance of having specific hospitals dedicated to elective surgery according to Prof Deborah McNamara colorectal surgeon at Beaumont Hospital and vicepresident of the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland RCSI Reflecting on the impact of the pandemic on surgical procedures Prof McNamara says patients needing operations were the net losers in hospitals because so much capacity was given over to treating Covid In the big hospitals we never stopped operating and we were dealing with the most complex patients with cancer and other conditions but operations took more time and the waiting lists increased even more she explains The only way we will ever cope with waiting lists is to ringfence surgery beds for elective patients Eighty per cent of patients on waiting lists in Ireland are awaiting a surgical procedure according to Prof McNamara Twothirds of these are waiting for a short intervention which doesnt require the patient to stay overnight Respiratory infections As we face into the winter season Prof McNamara says that during the expected increase in respiratory infections whether flu or Covid the first patients whose procedures will be postponed will be elective patients These patients are not as visible as others waiting on trolleys because they are at home Emergency department patients will always win over elective patients she claims The Sláintecare report proposes new hospitals in Dublin Cork and Galway specifically for elective surgeries day cases overnight cases and surgical procedures including scopes on the bladder stomach bowel and ear nose and throat Prof McNamara doesnt believe the National Treatment Purchase Fund is a suitable longterm mechanism to solve waiting lists because it constrains capacity in the original hospitals thus never allowing them to maintain their staff capacity and expertise to treat enough patients in the future Surgical care pathways surgical training opportunities and career progression for surgical nurses are all disturbed by a system that takes patients out of hospitals so resources arent built up to cope with future demand she argues Prof Barry says that in the long term demand for surgery in Ireland is on the increase both due to overall population increase and our population getting older The National Doctors Training and Planning unit in the HSE projects that we will need per cent more consultant surgeons by says Prof Barry who is also the director of national surgical training at the RCSI Currently there are just over consultant surgeons working in public and private hospitals in Ireland per cent of whom are over And while the RCSI has increased the number of trainees on its eightyearlong postgraduate surgical training programmes by about onethird to intakes per year alongside another nonconsultant doctors working directly under the supervision of consultant surgeons it will be a challenge to ratchet up consultant surgeon numbers to adequate levels as older surgeons retire and some trained surgeons choose to work abroad Robotic surgery In October the RCSI began introducing robotic surgical training The introduction of laparoscopic keyhole surgery in the late was a revolution in minimally invasive surgery and robotic surgery is the next revolution It offers significant benefits to patients in terms of precision technical refinement and the protection of normal tissue explains Prof Barry It is particularly apt for urological gynaecological colorectal and neurosurgery adds Prof Barry who suggests robotic surgery works best for elective surgeries with dedicated teams trained specifically in its techniques My job is about coping with the demands of elective and emergency surgery on any given day but ideally as we move towards the introduction of these new technologies elective and emergency surgery should have their own operating theatres The high level of bed occupancy in Irish hospitals is another concern Hospital bed occupancy is very high in Ireland around per cent When patients are waiting for a bed in the emergency department its hard for best practice per cent bed occupancy at any one time to be maintained says Prof McNamara Leaving beds in hospital wards empty for a certain period of time is the best way to prevent hospitalacquired infections In the Netherlands when a patient leaves the hospital the bed is taken out for an industrial cleaning process and a new bed is put in its place she explains Speaking in general about how patients can best prepare themselves for surgery Prof McNamara says that all the simple advice applies Stay healthy stay fit eat well and stop smoking Even someone who stops smoking two weeks before surgery reduces the risk of surgery increases blood flow and wound healing she explains She also advises patients to know and understand the medications they are on before coming to hospital for a surgical procedure She believes that patients should have the option to be treated by a male or female surgeon if they have a preference especially for surgery on intimate parts of the body Older men with prostate cancer might not be as comfortable with a female surgeon and for Muslim women having access to a female surgeon might mean that they will get healthcare that otherwise they might not seek help for

London’s older Irish community fearful Wörter November      Dublin man Jimmy Clare emigrated to London years ago but the cost of living crisis in London is making him consider returning to family in Ireland even after all these years in the UK It is an absolute scandal The bills are going up and up and up all the time The cost of food is devastating absolutely devastating said the single man from Drimnagh It is knocking my savings It is depleting them very very fast Clare was one of about older people mostly Irish who enjoyed a roast chicken dinner at the Thursday Lunch Club in a church hall in Finsbury Park north London this week The weekly event is hosted by the Irish Elderly Advice Network IEAN a charity that helps older Irish people living across London As ethnic communities go the Irish in London are among the oldest For years this lunch was a way for older Irish people including the single and the widowed to socialise and enjoy a hot meal Now as soaring food electricity and gas bills eat into pensions and savings it is serving other purposes it helps reduce household bills and will be a warm shelter during the winter months They come to places like this where they get dinners for £ € It stops people having to do pay out for a big shop said Maria Lane one of the charitys trustees clearing empty plates and glasses from tables in the small hall This weeks lunch fell on the same day the Bank of England warned that UK was facing the longest recession in a century and that the unemployment rate would almost double by Clare and others in the church hall were following the grim news closely The UK is heading for devastation Brexit has made it even worse and we havent felt the effect of Brexit yet because the pandemic has taken everybodys mind away from what is happening around us The consequences of Brexit are just around the corner he said At the next table Brendan Finnegan originally from Co Offaly but living in London for almost a halfcentury believes that the coming recession will be worse than the crash The retired accountant is worried about what spending the Conservative government led by new prime minister Rishi Sunak might cut when the Tories reveal their fiscal plan on November to fill the £ billion € billion black hole left by Liz Trusss disastrous premiership They are going to cut benefits That is the crux of the matter because there is an awful lot of people who are on benefits said Finnegan Sitting opposite him Michael Kilkenny who left Co Galway for London in is on disability benefit and has borrowed against the value of his Essex home through equity release finance to cover rising electricity bills and to make ends meet They will make cuts where they can the Tories have been cutting things for the last years there are not many more cuts they can make he said referring to how long the party has been in power Kilkenny is feeling the cost of living increases his electricity bill recently doubled to £ a month There is already £ borrowed against his home with compound interest of per cent pushing the cost of debt up every year By the time I die there wont be much money left in the house he said Neither man believes that Sunak will raise the UKs state pension in line with inflation in this months plan under the socalled pensions triple lock the pledge to raise pensions every year by whichever is highest inflation average earnings or per cent Inflation is running at per cent the highest level in years so this would require a large increase in spending The triple lock was suspended during the pandemic because of unusually large rise in average earnings Sunak has so far not committed to restoring it They wont pay it Kilkenny said Times are already tough even before the coming fiscal pain Finnegan says that without local food banks in the sixth richest country in the world the situation would be dire He recalls seeing an older man recently at a local supermarket till having to put tomatoes back and pull bananas off a bunch he had chosen in his shopping because he only had £ to spend It really broke my heart to see it he said Finnegan puts his accounting background to use at the network helping other older Irish people with their bills He recalled one woman receiving a recent bill for £ for electricity that she could not pay She was absolutely distraught She thought she had committed the crime of the century to owe that money Her pension didnt even come near that said Finnegan In a back office Nora Mulready chief executive of the IEAN says older people are regularly coming in with unmanageable gas or electricity bills that have jumped from two to three digits The bills are a shock for these settled older Irish people who emigrated from a less wealthy Ireland decades ago they know where every pound is going in the week or month The network helps negotiate with the energy companies to knock some money off for people or find hardship grants she says It also tries to take a holistic approach to helping them financially searching for other allowances benefits or health supports to help the pensioners It is such painstaking work said Mulready The unseasonably warm weather experienced in London recently has helped the situation a little but preparations are still being made for the winter ahead Mulready says Hackney Council one of Londons boroughs has asked her if the Thursday Lunch Club could be added to its list of warm hubs it is creating and planning to distribute to help older people through the winter It is dystopian There has something gone very wrong when we are saying that it is the norm for people to have to go somewhere to get warm for a few hours she said In the hall Finnegan has heard talk of the heat or eat choice that some older people will face this winter This is a concern for other charities It is really worrying because older people are stuck between a rock and a hard place Some wont be able to afford to heat their homes to a decent temperature or doing so will mean that they cannot afford other basics said Abigail Wood chief executive of the older peoples charity Age UK London The charity has assessed the disproportionate impact of the cost of living crisis on older people in London It published data last month which showed that per cent of older Londoners those over live in poverty compared with per cent in the rest of England while per cent were in fuel poverty compared with per cent in the rest of England The charity said the data was collected before the pandemic so it is likely that poverty will increase even further in the current economic climate Wood said the findings were alarming The knockon effect on older peoples health is a concern for those working on the frontline London GP Dr Hina Shahid chair of the Muslim Doctors Association which aims to reduce health inequities affecting the marginalised has treated patients from the Irish community She has seen elderly patients delay seeking care because of rising bills and older patients suffer flareups in respiratory conditions due to cold homes because they have rationed heat to reduce bills When somebody has to think about putting food on the table or whether they pay their rent those things take precedence over health and so what that means is that the health needs become neglected and so patients tend to present a bit later or significantly later she said At the Thursday Lunch Club over his roast chicken dinner Jimmy Clare says his involvement with the Irish Elderly Advice Network kept me alive during because the regular contact with the network meant he never felt alone with people ringing him day after day That kept my brain and body stimulated It eliminated loneliness and isolation he said He sees a new challenge in the years ahead he is very much concerned about the financial impact of Britains recession on him and older people in London like him I have a few more years left in my body and by the time I go down the big hole or into the incinerator I will be devastated he said

November      NOEL McADAM They still gather every Sunday A small everdiminishing group of men all members of the Orange Order persist each week in drawing attention to their plight It is more than years since the local district was last able to complete its oncetraditional church parade via the mainly nationalist Garvaghy Road back into Portadown in Co Armagh the county where the Order was born Their standoff with local residents once had the potential to bring Northern Ireland to a virtual standstill with thousands of families fleeing into the South or abroad to avoid the July Twelfth fortnight Now however nature has recaptured the fields and drains where once trenches barbed wire and bollards separated Orange brethren and their supporters from the security forces Famously it was where two men later to become first ministers David Trimble and Ian Paisley now both deceased joined and held their hands high as the march finished near the Orange Orders district offices in Carleton Street But that was the last time the march happened in and the standard flags and regalia of the Portadown District Lodge still remain within the Church of Ireland church where they will stay says the district master until the impasse is resolved Two district masters Harold Gracey and Darryl Hewitt have also died since the last parade but Portadown man Nigel Dawson has taken up the cudgels and with his district is determined to put Drumcree back on the agenda in time for the anniversary next year The district lodge has already formally requested a meeting with Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Chris HeatonHarris and also intends to meet political parties and other organisations In stark contrast to previous years the annual walk from the church to police lines at a nearby bridge was almost entirely ignored by the media this year Dawson however insists It should be of concern to the media and wider population that rights that are enjoyed in other parts of the United Kingdom have had restrictions placed upon them here The media should be highlighting and reporting on this and asking questions of our politicians both locally and in Westminster In talks stretching back years with the Parades Commission which has also undergone several personnel changes through the years the Orange side has agreed to several compromises to reduce the numbers taking part in the return parade at what time it takes place and form it takes without bands Negotiating table Yet the commission has found it impossible to persuade the Garvaghy Road Residents Coalition to return to the negotiating table It continues to insist there is only one issue the parades route Any attempt to facilitate an Orange march along Garvaghy Road would bring to the fore issues anxieties and fears that the residents believe should be allowed to remain in the past they have told the commission And they argue past attempts at dialogue have been futile and disingenuous because it is the route of the parade which is the main bone of contention and the community has moved on Dialogue The most recent commission determination however recognised the issue has not gone away by reiterating the need for a solution and noting it is the residents rather than the Orange Order that is preventing this from happening A spokesperson said The commission continues to encourage all parties to this parading dispute to enter dialogue to achieve an accommodation which reflects the needs of the local communities but we do not have the statutory power to force parties into dialogue or mediation Mr Dawson meanwhile has argued Whilst the commission has tweaked determinations following our meetings it is obliged to do much more than that and must now step up to the mark It is well documented which party is working to seek a resolution and which is refusing The weekly Sunday protests were suspended several times during the pandemic and the mourning period following the death of Queen Elizabeth but have returned and at one stage were expanded to twice a week It is relatively rare for more than one or two women to attend but officers from the Grand Lodge and from lodges across the North regularly join the ranks It remains a very real issue in our town says Dawson who also argues it should be given the same level of attention by politicians as the costofliving crisis It should be high on their agenda along with the current costofliving crisis No doubt the political inbox is full of important issues but the rights of its citizens the famous shared space and the parity of esteem seem to have slipped and need to be brought back to the fore The province cant fully move on until all citizens enjoy civil and equal rights on many aspects of life including parades We hear a lot about shared space and identity it is time for more than words adds the senior Orange member who was deputy to both Gracey and Hewitt Many lodge members were lost to the pandemic but numbers have gone up again over the last year to about one of the largest districts in the North At one stage Orange members would have filled several of the lay positions in the church on the hill but this is also no longer the case 
388,../data/sec_IRL/Irish Times/Factiva-20230807-170,no section An alternative Ulster of dissenting voices A valuable series of conversations with people who were brought up in the North and found it wanting Wörter November      For a place so grimly determined by politics and religion the North of Ireland has a strangely intangible history Questions as to where the North begins and ends have puzzled generations of artists and thinkers and more so recently as the future of the last centurys partition comes into question Seamus Deane began by thinking about the North as a latterday Atlantis sunk by separation Later he considered it a fifth province which he worked to creative shape as part of the Field Day collective Peace changed the outline of the North again as did the acknowledgment and inclusion of womens voices in the Norths political leadership and in its cultural landscape Now the prospect of the future looks uncertain once more in a landscape deformed by the continuing legacies of partition and inflamed by Brexit The essential problem of the North remains then as Anna Burns put it in Milkman of how to see clearly Claire Mitchells meditation on this problem of orientation is The Ghost Limb a memoir and a meditation that reflects on her experience of growing up in and living through the late Troubles The legacies of this time are deeply personal and inescapably social In response there is a yearning throughout the book for those warm moments of music and conversation where strangers become friends and where the imagination runs in front of reserve The book begins and ends like this in scenes that carry all the weight of the quiet times of the pandemic in between The past few years have led many people to reassess their lives and their friendships and their place in the world That reformation meets Mitchells memories of the past with particular force especially as she uses her time in the book to meet other northerners many of whom are equally unsettled in their optimism for the place and its people The idea ofThe Ghost Limb is that among the Protestant communities of the North there is a hidden history of social radicalism that owes its genesis to the revolutionary innovations of the United Irishmen The idea itself is not new and might as easily explain the Norths reactionary traditions as much as its republican an affiliation that many individuals in Mitchells book are coming to new terms with There is little in the book of the Norths other hidden histories of pogrom and expulsion which have left a toxic residue at least as long lasting as the Battle of Ballynahinch After all Ian Paisleys paramilitary Third Force paraded the same Newtownards square as the United Irishmen did two centuries before The Ghost Limb is a window into a society in slow transition An empathetic listener and a careful writer Mitchells observations range over similar social territory as the subtle fictions of Jan Carson The substance of the book is a series of conversations with people who were brought up in the North and found it wanting which might be its abiding majority Partition is a deep scar in this psychic landscape having cut one generation off from another in the reduced circumstances of the wee six Linda Ervines account of starting Irish language communities in East Belfast is a rebuke to the limitations separation placed on Protestant communities that had their own multilingual inheritances torched by the demand to conform or be condemned Further north in Larne Angeline King works similarly hard to amplify Ulster Scots in contemporary literature Ciaran Carson thought of the recourse to one language as the entry to a prison house and I thought as I read about Ervine and King of how insightful Ciaran and his friend Aodán Mac Póilin were in their commitment to uncover Belfasts subterranean cultural histories Similarly in a book in which Protestant is often shorthand for Presbyterian both would have enjoyed Ervines aside that her fathers family were all Church of Ireland but they were all atheists and communists The Ghost Limb is a dreamers manifesto that has an unexpected precursor in John Moriartys spiritual explorations which points to the possibility that Mitchells sense of displacement might echo across all Ireland One of The Ghost Limbs essential truths is the connection of so many northerners to the rest of the island in their family histories their education and their affinity Mitchell has a gift for listening and the books diversity of stories from the evolution of Corrymeela as a welcoming space for LGBTQ communities to the general insistence that people of all persuasions are focused primarily on healthcare and education is a window into the contemporary North that can be hard to see through the hot air blasts of the Protocol Mitchells North is a fragile landscape stretched thin over centuries of contradiction Remarkably its stony soil holds within it the seed of something present and greater the outline of which emerges from Mitchells commitment to listen to reflect and to go on If Protestantism seems an old bone to worry over in the context of the contemporary world Mitchells vital attention to the brave and moving stories of people like Stephen McCracken and Gail McConnell makes for powerful reading Some of the books ideas are quixotic such as that Protestants are the forgotten Irish and thinking more about the North as a shared European space might better build a collective peace But its quirks are as nothing compared to the richness of Mitchells ethical attention to the spectrum of people born in the North who wish for something different from what history has provided This is a book about love Mitchell writes and how we need more of that 
389,../data/sec_IRL/Irish Times/Factiva-20230807-170,Weekend PLENTY OF GRACES BUT NO AIRS The hardest part is thinking of myself as a pensioner I’m still in my head’ Wörter November      What does it feel like when the lights go down and the credits begin to roll and the main evening news the big stories the grim statistics have been delivered to the nation There have been nights when Eileen Dunne has left the studio to find Montrose fizzing after some political intrigue and other times those humdrum winter Tuesdays all of Ireland weatherbattered and indoors when the corridors are as bright and ghostly as a latenight supermarket aisle Friday night last was different Dunnes final announcement was to call time on herself after four decades working in the nerve centre of RTÉ The newsroom in Montrose is notoriously poor at keeping inhouse secrets but this one did not get out The delivery style did not change understated warm and lit with an unmistakable sincerity as she thanked her colleagues and viewers with the closing words Its been an honour and a privilege See you on the other side Then she stepped from the studio into a corridor to find a line of colleagues waiting They formed a loose guard of honour and applauded as she took her first steps away from it all Flowers cake a few bottles popped Afterwards she went to the Trocadero restaurant with family and a best friend It must have been an odd sensation closing a bulletin out by reading the autocue featuring a news item about herself Only in the sense that you know I hope I can get through this without having a wobble she says when we meet a few days later She is a sports fan and cannot help but keep an eye on the World Cup match on the hotel television Proper winter has arrived it is dark by the leaves swirl outside and the nearby is already seething with headlights But I had kind of rehearsed it I said to them I could have done it without the autocue but then it is good to have it in front of you too The hardest part is thinking of myself as a pensioner thinking that I have been there for years Where the hell does that go Im still in my head Reassuring presence To work as a newscaster is different to any other frontofhouse role within RTÉ The State broadcaster is inevitably a kind of dream machine Innumerable people have gone in there as journalists only to be reshaped as entertainers as personalities  is different The conventions of formality cannot be abandoned Personality and opinion must be muted Over the years Dunne developed a style that might be described as plenty of graces but no airs She was dependable and serious but not without fun She was reserved and fairminded and became known as a reassuring presence through all seasons You should never know how I feel about the news I am reading she says of her guiding principle Because I am the messenger not the message And that works both ways In a sense you can trust me because you know Im not coming with an agenda And it works for me because I only let you see as much of my personality as I choose to But it is she agrees the strangest of roles To be a newscaster in Ireland is to be a kind of apparition appearing nightly in hundreds of thousands of homes Dunne started parttime in RTÉ as a continuity announcer in She was first on television in the summer of reading the sports results on The Sunday Game when many of the department regulars were at the Los Angeles Olympics She moved to the newsroom that September and while her inaugural television news bulletin passed by in a blur of nervous energy she felt dismayed after her second ever bulletin I just didnt feel too great about it she remembers As she gathered her thoughts Charles Mitchel then in the final months of an august career approached her and said something to her that she would herself pass on to younger colleagues Mitchel told her My dear always remember somebody thought you were good enough to put you there Mitchel was RTÉs original newsreader and a towering presence in Irish life when RTÉ literally had a captive audience If he imbued the latest factory closure or political scandal with a thespian gravitas that is because he had been an accomplished stage actor before finding his way onto television Dunnes emergence coincided with the transformation from pure newsreader who faithfully and in Mitchels case beautifully read aloud the script to newscaster complete with live links instudio interviews breaking news and later the visual pyrotechnics made possible by technological advancement She rose quickly In the the nine oclock news was scheduled for minutes and was the flagship news programme She joined Anne Doyle as copresenter I have to nail this lie that Caitriona Perry and Keelan Shanley were the first two women to copresent the news she laughs while fondly remembering Shanley who died in Anne was the constant and she had me one week and Don Cockburn the next I dont bark at people In the SixOne news started The first presenters were Sean Duignan and Dunne Since then hers was the voice through which the country sat down to be told of the litany of controversies the heartbreaks the faroff wars and atrocities the anticipated arrival of Santa Claus Analysts and political leaders would materialise in studio for onthespot interviews Dunne never overplayed her hand it was her view that the newscasters role is to remain impartial to ask the questions without interrogating aggressively In a news interview it is never going to be that long she says And sometimes we underestimate our viewers Ye are not stupid If a fella is waffling you can see he is waffling You dont need me to haul him over the coals over it Funny during Covid we had Tony Holohan in one night Now Tony Holohan never came on the nine oclock unless he had something to say And no matter what you threw at Tony Holohan it would bounce straight off him He was a smooth operator There was some confusion over something and I was trying to get the information He came in to clear up that confusion so he was fine and I knew that and knew I could push him But I got letters giving out to me for being hard on Dr Holohan I would never have been criticised for that I can ask a relevant question but I dont bark at people Over the years she learned that some interviewees were simply more comfortable than others with the art form of live television where disaster is just one slip of the tongue away The practice is for studio guests to be seated in studio three or four minutes before the interview begins usually during the commercial break to make sure they are ready Enda Kenny would breeze in and chat about Mayo or Dublin football while he waited Bertie Ahern was also comfortable in that environment It came easily to him But for Leo Varadkar it doesntyou must make the effort for him Leo reminds me of Mary Robinson I think he has to work all the harder at it I would have to break the ice just to make him feel more comfortable There could be terse moments with certain interviewees and in the inevitable way of things she found herself warming to some people more than others It depends on the personality Some of them are ignorant anyway they dont need controversy to come across like that And again we will name no names Voice is everything in broadcast The greats are not remembered for what they say as much as how they say it Dunne followed her father into RTÉ Mick Dunne was one of a cabal of GAA journalists who in the were almost as garlanded as the players they covered If Michael OHehir was the voice of AllIreland final Sundays and Mícheál Ó Muircheartaighs radio broadcasts a sort of summer accompaniment it is arguable that Mick Dunnes tone a sort of Baroque midlands perhaps was the quintessence of the GAA at a certain time Once heard it was never forgotten As a child Eileen and her sisters Myra and Una would be packed into the car when their father was covering games in Killarney or Clones He was feted and took it in his stride And it made his daughter aware of the rules of recognition Brought up to be independent Its no big deal to see Anne Doyle or Pat Kenny walking down Grafton Street But if you go down the country is it her And if is what is she doing here And they are not going to rest until they find out But I was used to that with Daddy I grew up with it My mother used to say now I walk behind the pair of ye Mick Dunne died in Her mother Lily is in her and remains hale My mother was a civil servant who had to give it up the day she got married and resented it for years until she could go back to work And did We were always brought up to be independent I went to school in Manor House in Raheny The nuns were encouraging In my class alone we had Moya Doherty the cofounder of Riverdance Aileen OToole cofounder of the Business Post Bridget McManus the former secretary general of the Department of Education We were told to get out and do it Even as Dunne chronicled the transformation of Ireland through the thousands of news bulletins she also lived through them The common portrayal of the and as relentlessly grim and stagnant does not necessarily speak of her experience it was far from perfect but more nuanced than the bleak brush strokes suggest Well it is not my truth The were brilliant That is my era I started going out to discos went to France to study It was when I came of age I was lucky in that I came back and got a job when a lot of people including my sister were going away But a friend of mine who also went away for work was gobsmacked every time she came back here Just at the pubs She always said there is no recession in this country Pubs were heaving We had a different attitude She knows she was fortunate too During her parttime years in RTÉ when she was studying the HDip with a view to teaching she worked in Burgerland one of the first Irish fastfood chains She became friendly with a woman from one of the Italian fastfood restaurants who was essentially there to broaden her knowledge of the family trade She told Dunne that she envied her the thought of college and an unmapped future was impossibly exotic And I said to her You know what you do Keep working Get the money Go yourself to college Id love to know what became of her Reliability As the years rolled reliability became Dunnes distinctive broadcast trait Taoisigh fashions hairstyles came and went but the television audience knew where they stood with her The country to which she read the news changed around her Dunne is a practising Catholic and for a time presented a weekly radio show The God Slot The era when Vatican correspondents reported every papal utterance passed And although Dunne was shocked and disappointed by the deluge of clerical sexual abuse scandal which has brought the institution to its knees she is uncomfortable with the idea that the practice of religious faith has also passed I kind of feel we are blaming every priest for everything that ever happened and it is just not fair I think sometimes the media likes to pretend that the church is totally dead in this country But its not Its not Look at Fr John Joe Duffy up in Creeslough I do think it is a more caring church and this pope is a more caring pope There is a lot you couldnt agree with about the church I could have been born a Muslim in Islamabad or a Protestant in Belfast I was born with the gift of faith Catholicism is the means by which I express it The election of Mary Robinson as president in was a moment of lasting significance to her She was a news watcher that day at home on the couch where she could respond with emotions that would have been banished had she been on air One of the things that drew her to Robinson is her essential reticence the sense that the public communication did not come naturally to her She nearly hangs back when she is walking as if someone is going to come at her And as I say I think Leo is a bit the same I think they are so alike But the tears rolled down my face that day I was so proud And after Italia Just the confidence coming into the nation The bubbling optimism of the and the sense of a young country starting to ascend contributed to a golden decade for RTÉ its last as the untouchable broadcast king of the analogue age Commercial rivals and more recently the multifaceted challenges of digital competition have led to a shifting uncertain landscape Five years ago Dunne contemplated leaving RTÉ She found herself resistant to visual improvisations and changes standing rather than the traditional seated behind the desk Through it all she had remained faithful to the idea that she should be a conduit not a distraction In an age of everyday celebrity she never acquired an agent because she never did any extras She loved RTÉ and the newsroom and was worried about where it was headed What was she worried about Sort of maybe dumbing down a bit And technology and the digital world taking over and throwing the baby out with the bath water and all that kind of thing But I think Covid rebalanced a lot of that We went back to basics For a brief period during the pandemic the RTÉ hair and makeup department was closed Now thats a firstworld problem she laughs But when you are used to having it done Letters and postcards came steadily during that surreal period when people across the land many living alone sent notes just to say that it was comforting to see her there a constant recognisable presence in a disorienting time Those notes made that period memorable They have flowed in by text and post since her final newscast last week She will join the audience now as an inveterate news follower Grounded Travel plans with her husband the actor Macdara Ó Fátharta are on the cards She is far too grounded to ever fret about losing her identity now that she is no longer popping up on televisions screens But it will take a while for her to absorb the fact that she has crossed the same threshold as Charles Mitchel all those Novembers ago exiting Montrose for the last time It is changing Dunne says of the institution she leaves behind And you just dont know where all of that is going to lead for all media How does  survive how does RTÉ survive By going digital But nobody has found a sustainable method for that yet RTÉ has the same reach I think but probably not the same power that it used to have I do think when there is a big Irish story people still tune into RTÉ But less and less so My son Cormac is He wouldnt sit down and watch the news But he knows everything that is going on She checks herself then and leans into her sentence as she occasionally did at the end of a light news item when she could chance a bit of mischief in her tone of voice Now he did sit down and watch the bulletin last Friday night Hed have been shot if he didnt But he had a tip off

podcaster comedian Jarlath Regan hitting Liberty Hall Theatre next month and the wildly successful My Therapist Ghosted Me at the Gaiety in February As we move out of our bunkers and into the world at large live shows are all about podcasters meeting the audiences they grew when it was just us and our AirPods Beyond delivery platforms and money matters though theres the content One marked trend of note in was an uptick and investment in narrative fiction podcasts This years first big success in that arena was Batman Unburied the result of a deal between Warner Bros and Spotify inked in that turned into audio gold When the first episodes dropped in May of this year it knocked Rogan off the top of the Spotify charts and garnered millions of listeners across the world from Mexico and India to Brazil and Italy with highlyproduced audio big name actors and a slick suspenseful and fresh script Radio plays Fiction in podcasting isnt new Welcome to Night Vale has been going since after all and dont get me started on the radio plays these century iterations are rooted in but The Archers can definitely take a bow However narrative fiction in this space is really gaining some momentum and big names are paying attention After Batman Unburieds big success we learned in May that Spotify had promoted Gimlet Medias Mimi ODonnell to oversee scripted fiction on the platform Not long after came Case a riveting adaptation of a Chilean hit about a psychiatrist and her maybe timetravelling patient starring Oscar Isaac and Julianne Moore That one also claimed Spotifys number one slot in Ireland the US Canada and Britain after its October release Now we close out the year with the latest fictional blockbuster Quiet Part Loud fresh to our ears thanks to Gimlet Media and Jordan Peeles Monkeypaw Productions Peele is executive producer and ODonnell directs this grim and unsettling set in the US soon after with Tracy Lett playing a rightwing radio host spewing xenophobia who loses his slot when he starts broadcasting conspiracy theories about three disappeared Muslim teens from Staten Island Peele has said hes hoping it will be the scariest podcast of all time and parts of it are definitely terrifying though which parts depends on whether your phobia is paranormal earworms or Rush Limbaugh The audio design is nextlevel though a sonic experience and metaphorical horror that rings long after your pods are clicked back in their case In short for those predicting the imminent demise of the podcast offers proof of life aplenty The big streamers got bigger but the individual creators also found ways to bank their brilliance and what began with a showdown ends with a horror show Thank you for listening 
393,../data/sec_IRL/Irish Times/Factiva-20230807-170,Features Holders of hope’ the volunteers working over Christmas Hundreds of people are giving their time both in person and on helplines to support those in crisis over the holiday period Wörter Dezember      Its easy for people to forget how lonely Christmas can be or how stressful it can be if you are surrounded by family you dont have the best relationship with says Robert Foley a trainee psychotherapist who will be working on the text platform over the Christmas period Foley says the text service has been busier in the days before Christmas with mostly young people messaging about difficulties they are facing We get the full range of people contacting us from someone with suicidal thoughts to those feeling sad and needing the space to talk it through and explore their feelings Its rare not to have a shift when you hear from a number of people who are at risk of ending their lives says Foley Our job is to try and deescalate the situation to get them to have a safety plan or to reach out to the emergencies services he says Although working on a helpline over Christmas may sound like a bleak and depressing thing to do Foley says it can be inspiring to see how people can come up with their own resources to cope with their difficulties Were nondirective and try to identify skills they already have and how they have coped with these situations in the past Its about helping people move from an emotionally hot moment to a calm moment Foley who works as a supervisor of volunteers says he is also impressed by the generosity of volunteers giving up their time A lot of our volunteers have been through really difficult periods in their own lives and they want to pay it forward and help others who are struggling Typical volunteers Ahmed Mayouf and Aziz Ahmed who live in Direct Provision hotels in the Dublin area may not seem like typical volunteers for the South Dublin Volunteer Centre but these two young men will be working shifts at the refugee transit hub at Citywest Convention Centre over Christmas Mayouf came to Ireland about six months ago and spent a few nights in the transit hub at Citywest before moving to Dublin city centre Our job is to show the new arrivals around the facility where they register the accommodation area and the departure area where the buses come to take them to their next place says Mayouf who lived in Dubai and then illegally in the UK before coming to Ireland He received his work permit the week we met but his application for residency in Ireland hasnt been processed yet People need someone to talk to and I speak Arabic French English a bit of German We pick up the welcoming words in different languages and when we greet people in their own language it brings a big smile to their faces he says People who come from war zones are scared and terrified Our job is to try and ease their stress and show them that there is a light at the end of the tunnel I feel that I can spread positivity because Ive been in their shoes Ahmed left his native Somalia as a teenager and has lived in Ethiopia Saudi Arabia and Sweden before coming to Ireland seeking asylum He volunteers at the Citywest transit hub three days a week I also volunteer with the Muslim Sisters of Ireland in the city centre and with a homeless organisation says Ahmed who speaks Arabic Somali English Spanish and some Swedish Volunteering he says is a good way of giving back to society After the coronavirus pandemic and now the war in Ukraine everyone should take part and contribute what they can says Ahmed who also came to Ireland about six months ago He is studying social policy in Crumlin College He also received his work permit recently The South Dublin Volunteer Centre is asking the public to bring new or unused hats and gloves to give as presents to adults in the transit hub The St Stephens Green Trust has donated presents for any children who will be there on Christmas Day Active listener Jennifer Stanbridge will work on the Childline helpline over Christmas We get calls from children in crisis Some will have experienced physical or verbal abuse from their parents Others have been bullied Some will have issues with their mental health and selfesteem while others will have experienced bereaved and loss and feel isolated at Christmas time she says While some children phone Childline a lot of the contact is webbased live chat Our main role is to be an active listener its very powerful for a child to be listened to Children will tell us their feelings and thoughts and whats going on for them We encourage them to identify someone who they can reach out to for help We never tell a child what to do but if the child asks us for help and if its necessary well engage with the child and family agency and the gardaí she says Calls can be minutes to an hour After an hour we encourage the child to have a break and call us back she says Trained therapists The Pieta House crisis helpline offers support from trained therapists all year Clare McKim the crisis helpline therapy services manager says they expect to be busy over Christmas with calls already on the increase this year Our therapists are the holders of hope for people in crisis We offer emotional and nonjudgemental support The change in routine over Christmas can impact on peoples mental health with more alcohol and more social situations Complex family dynamics can also exacerbate mental health difficulties for those who dont have access to their usual support services over Christmas she says Twentysix therapists at Pieta House will work shorter shifts fourhour shifts instead of eight hours over the festive period The helpline is remote now which makes it easier Its actually a very rewarding experience to support someone in crisis It can bring perspective into your own life and remind us all that within the chaos of Christmas some people are having a difficult time and its important to support them McKim says we get many repeat callers but we also hear from people who call to say thank you which is heartwarming Some call to say if it wasnt for speaking to someone on the helpline last Christmas I wouldnt be here today For more information about giving back and volunteering see weactievolunteer 
395,../data/sec_IRL/Irish Times/Factiva-20230807-170,Opinion Stronger parish structures could benefit us all Wörter Dezember      The word parish has a particular resonance for Irish people Sometimes it means the parish church and sometimes the local community The central role played by parish in Irish life is even given a nod in the title of this newspapers longrunning series New to the Parish which focuses on the challenges faced by newcomers to Ireland Ireland would seem to be a prime candidate to have retained the parish as a local government unit Until I read a new book by Finola Kennedy Local Matters Parish Local Government and Community in Ireland I had never thought about how odd it is that it is much more common in England to have parish councils as civic structures although it is not universal there either Kennedy approaches the question of local communities in unusual and stimulating ways Few people would examine local government and faithbased parishes in the same book much less query whether they might form fruitful connections It is not as eclectic as it seems not least because local government and religious parishes were once much more closely related Kennedy traces the origin of the Irish civil parish system to the Normans After the Reformation Church of Ireland parishes often shared boundaries with the existing civil parishes although the new boundaries were not always identical Roman Catholic parishes were different again The civil parish was essentially an administrative area managed by a parish council while the church parish was in the care of the parish priest or minister Civil parishes were rendered more or less obsolete by the Local Government Ireland Act of For a long time after that the parish as a religious and social unit thrived although it is now seriously in decline Shenanigans When Handforth Parish Council in Cheshire became famous for all the wrong reasons during the pandemic many Irish people assumed they were looking at the shenanigans of a parish pastoral council a purely religious structure English people immediately understood that Handforth Parish Council was the most local level of government Jackie Weaver who became famous for remaining calm while under attack by irate councillors was a standin clerk brought in to try to make peace between warring factions The chaotic meeting spawned memes Tshirts and even songs based on phrases such as Jackie Weaver you have no authority here and Read the standing orders read them and understand them While Handforth Parish Council may have inadvertently provided comedy gold the decline of Irish local structures both civil and religious has far less entertaining consequences Local government is famously weak in Ireland starved of funds and reduced almost to simply administering the policies of the central government While Kennedy draws on copious research when it comes to social capital she focuses on economist Prof Raghuram Rajan and political scientist Prof Robert Putnam In his book The Third Pillar Rajan states that the strengthening of the state and market while our local communities weaken is responsible for problems as diverse as inequality the opioid crisis and the rise of populist nationalism Strong local communities are essential to sustainable economies These are large claims However it is clear that market forces globalisation and the influence of Big Tech have herded people into individualism or at best small groups of friends or families Positive social change cannot come about without local structures to facilitate them Take local authorities and housing Kennedy shows that between the and local authorities built nearly houses to rent Local authorities no longer have the capacity or perhaps the will to build on this scale Wellrehearsed negative social consequences flow from this Parishes as religious communities are also in decline with ageing parishioners and priests Kennedy is clear that parishes in the past are not some kind of Paradise Lost There was often snobbery and social division but parishes also contribute to a strong social fabric not just because of faithbased activities but as an antidote to loneliness and as a source of strong identities It is not clear what can easily replace them She is interested in seeing whether in this secular era new partnerships can be forged between local authorities and parishes including in areas like climate change and housing She points to Finglas West where a large church was demolished last year Plans drawn up by the stakeholders the Dublin Archdiocese Dublin City Council the HSE and the City of Dublin Education and Training Board include a new church and parish centre up to housing units including older persons housing a new primary care centre and upgraded sporting facilities for two schools This is the kind of fruitful partnership between parishes and local authorities that might provide a model for others As people head home to their parishes of origin at Christmas this is a good time to examine the significance of their decline possible routes to renewal and their relationship with local government Kennedy does not claim to have all the answers but she is certainly asking all the right questions 
396,../data/sec_IRL/Irish Times/Factiva-20230807-170,Ireland Romantic poetry in a fading language still manages to fill stadium crowds At this festival of Urdu love poems in New Delhi poets are lauded like pop stars even though language itself has been stigmatised Wörter Dezember      The four designated stages inside the crowded stadium complex in the heart of the busy capital werent enough So poetry lovers also took to the footpaths and the spaces in between turning them into impromptu openmic platforms for Indias embattled language of love In one corner of the festival grounds which had been draped in vibrant colours and calligraphy a group of university students alternated between singing popular romantic songs backed by a young man on guitar and jostling to recite verses of their own In your love one young poet began leaning into the huddle with confidence before forgetting the rest of his verse In your love he repeated unable to recall Dont worry someone from the crowd encouraged him as the others chuckled In love we all forget In another corner Pradeep Sahil a poet and lyricist handed his phone to a friend to record him as he placed a red chair at a busy spot and took a seat crossing his legs and reading poem after poem A crowd soon gathered cheering after every verse With no room on the main stage Sahil had found a stage of his own climbing atop his chair and reciting what felt like his entire book The times have changed and so has the poet I am half a businessman now half a poet That more than people came to celebrate Urdu poetry during the threeday festival this month in New Delhi was testament to the peculiar reality of the language in India For centuries Urdu was a prominent language of culture and poetry in India at times promoted by Mughal rulers Its literature and journalism often advanced by writers who rebelled against religious dogma played important roles in the countrys independence struggle against British colonial rule and in the spread of socialist fervour across the subcontinent later in the century Stigmatised In more recent decades the language has faced dual threats from communal politics and the quest for economic prosperity Urdu is now stigmatised as foreign the language of Indias archrival Pakistan Families increasingly prefer to enrol children in schools that teach English and other Indian languages better suited for the job market In our effort to get on the gravy train we left a lot behind on the platform Javed Akhtar a prominent poet and lyricist said at the festival And among those things we forgot on the platform was literature language poetry and other arts Yet Urdu has remained the key language of romantic expression in the songs and cinema that saturate Indian life Generations in India as well as across the wider subcontinent and in the diaspora have grown up humming songs from Bollywood musicals that draw heavily on Urdu poetry Knowingly or unknowingly Urdu has been their language of angst heartbreak and celebration Urdu is a composite language Its grammar and syntax are indigenous to India but it draws its script and a heavy share of its vocabulary from Persian and Arabic influences that came on the back of Muslim invasions The rich tradition of poetry music and art that developed from this confluence became known as the GangaJamuni culture a meeting of the two great rivers with those names After Pakistan adopted Urdu as its national language with the bloody partition of India in the tongue increasingly took on an Islamic identity in India a marginalisation that has only intensified with the recent rise of the Hindu right The governing partys rightwing support base has long focused on purifying Indian culture with the only acceptable confluence one in which it subsumes other streams The poetry festival known as JashneRekhta which was in its seventh edition is part of a decadeold effort to bridge the gap between the languages wide emotional connection and its receding accessibility It all began in with a website Rekhtaorg started by Sanjiv Saraf an engineer and businessman who was a lifelong lover of music set to Urdu poetry and had just begun learning the script at age He wanted to make a small number of good Urdu poems accessible by presenting each in three different scripts in the original Urdu in Devanagari the script of Hindi and in English transliteration Readers could click on any word to get a popup of its meaning Sarafs organisation the Rekhta Foundation has since expanded its mission to reviving the Urdu language Dozens of its employees travel around India to scan and archive works from old libraries and private collections making outof print Urdu books available digitally The Rekhta website now has about million users annually twothirds of them younger than The site has so far made available more than pieces of work by more than poets In many ways Urdus poetic tradition gives it an advantage in the era of social media and short attention spans The building block of much of Urdu poetry is a simple sher two versed lines in which the first sets up an idea and the second completes it The emotional power of this language to express the deepest emotions in the shortest possible construct Saraf said you cannot help but fall in love with the language The poetry festival was held for the first time since the pandemic and there was an undertone about the fragility of life Singer Hariharan captivated the audience with a slow meditation on life taken from a poem by Muzaffar Warsi To make it or to break it it takes no time Life is but a house of dew on the petals of a flower Among the crowd that spilled out of the large tent where Hariharan performed was Snigdha Kar an environmentalist and her seven yearold daughter Shreyashri As the singer dwelled on one line of poetry repeating it over and over Kar closed her eyes letting the notes sink in Grounding Music and poetry provide a moment of grounding in a fastmoving world of work travel and family obligations she said While Kar said she had always been moved by lyrics and poetry I used to pay attention to the words more she said she has started classical lessons online during the pandemic to understand the music too I also bought a guitar she said adding with a sheepish smile You know classical music could become boring sometimes The festivals main attraction was the poetry sessions from openmic opportunities where budding poets nervously recited their works trying to stick to metre and rhyme to masterclasses that encouraged them to keep composing even if they were struggling with the basics of Urdu script or form Poetry is not just arranging words poet Suhail Azad who took early retirement as a police officer to focus fulltime on poetry told attendants of one masterclass If it reaches the heart it is poetry At the festivals headline poetry recital the mushaira a half dozen senior poets took their seats on the stage enchanting the audience in distinct styles often to standing ovations Some of the poets sang their verses like melodious songs Others such as Shakeel Azmi brought the same dynamism as a stage performer moving away from the lectern building up the suspense of the second verse by repeating the first over and over Open your wings the people are watching your flight Sitting on the ground why are you staring at the sky The more senior poets such as Fahmi Badayuni brought the quiet swagger and simplicity of a bygone era both in demeanour and verse Before he recited his work Badayuni wearing a pink sweater fur hat and checkered scarf acknowledged the audiences connection with his art by noting that his poems had gone viral Those who are unaware of your scent They make do with flowers The crowd roared after every verse many standing to shout Once more The master of ceremonies stopped Badayuni to offer an observation His verses were so good that people were also whistling in appreciation Keep whistling like that brother and you may get a job in the railways the MC joked with the crowd Badayuni then went back to reciting another sher He repeated the first line to the audiences attentive silence and curiosity then landed its kicker to their eruption I keep reading it day and night The letter that she never wrote The New York Times 
397,../data/sec_IRL/Irish Times/Factiva-20230807-170,Weekend A European’s life My grandmother’s passion for peace Pamela Klimcke grew up in London during the Blitz and dealt with the culture shock of authoritative Ireland before becoming involved in charitable organisations during the Troubles Wörter Dezember      Ican remember looking out of my bedroom window and it was just one mass of yellow red and yellow from fire my grandmother told me in one of our talks that I recorded before she died She was remembering the bombing of London that she lived through as a child You could see the whole sky which was full of the red of bombing of the flames My grandmother was born Pamela Addison in arriving into the world along with her twin sister Yvonne Ive always been a we instead of an I as she once put it The twins grew up in north London with their older sister Daphne and from the age of five saw little of their father because he was drafted to fight in the second World War We did have all these things you read about Gas masks you went to school with that hanging off your neck she said Yvonne remembered rushing to the bomb shelter next door when the sirens sounded and eventually managing to fall asleep under the table It was a disordered period The twins were evacuated repeatedly to different places sometimes separated from their mother and from Daphne sometimes together once for a memorably happy period to live in the rambling family home of the editor of a newspaper called the Congleton Chronicle When things seemed to have quietened down the family would venture back to London again The local children adapted to the strange normality collecting shrapnel as a hobby prizing interesting shapes Items broke in the house due to the bombing and the windows were smashed When the war cut close the adults began to talk of leaving again You know if somebody they knew had been bombed out or lost their leg Yvonne said A row of houses at the end of their street disappeared in a huge explosion one night And then we had another time when there was a stray German bomber and he had gone across London and he had shot at people down the high street Yvonne said We were walking home and he shot at us so we fell on the floor I think then my mother probably said were off Its getting too close For one period they lived in a house that had been requisitioned by the state as accommodation for evacuees It was an unhappy period We were in Cheshire and so its a different accent my grandmother said They were resented Simply because we were foreign if you like she said Some local children put dead frogs through the letterbox and slit their tummies and things she said I discovered at a very early age that it doesnt take much to be different The twins credit their happy memories of the time to the creativity of their mother Margaret She was very gifted Pamela said They would create model shops and theatres out of nothing and invent stories about them Margaret had collections of scrap and cloth to work with she was a top tailor on Savile Row The two picked up her sewing skills though osmosis Some time after peace was declared their father Leonard a figure who for half their lives had featured in the form of letters and packages arriving from afar returned one day in a taxi to their London house Pamela said she watched him bend down to pay the fare The back of his neck He was just so thin You could see this she broke off gesturing with her hand It was the bone structure She was The feeling of shame she felt about being nervous of her father stayed with her all her life Of the twins Pamela was the outgoing one said Yvonne Both were creative Yvonne spent the early days of the pandemic lockdowns trying to capture the vivid sunsets in paint Pam tended towards the written word Little stories and poems and things She was always writing Yvonne told me Her headmaster was telling her she should try to do something with the writing when she left school she wanted to get into Fleet Street Possibly due to a letter of recommendation from that headmaster the details are lost to time Pamela landed a role as secretary to an editor of an exciting magazine called Everybodys Her dream she once told me was that by the age of she would be working as a journalist and driving a convertible MG She went on to get a role as an editorial assistant on an interdenominational Christian publication The Addisons were not a religious family and had little record of churchgoing But Yvonne pinpoints this as the moment Pamela began to develop her deep faith One evening a schoolfriend phoned up Pamela and suggested they go to The Royalty dance hall that Saturday It wasnt my grandmothers favourite she found the crowd a bit older and standoffish but she agreed Many decades later she still remembered what she was wearing It was a dress of shot silk taffeta that shimmered between red and green as she moved her own creation like all her evening clothes She wore two earrings both on one ear and velvet shoes that tipped up at the front a bit like an Aladdin lamp She was and it was My grandad remembers that it was about when he saw Pamela across the ballroom There was Pam It was like a light across a room he told me They were engaged six weeks later Raymond Klimcke carrying the surname of Silesian immigrant ancestors had grown up not far away in north London where he had lived unevacuated throughout the Blitz By being the youngest he had escaped the fate of his brother father and uncles who had all been sucked into the machinery of European war in the preceding decades many dying others coming back deeply traumatised Called up for national service in the air force and discharged to peacetime Raymond found work as a civilian pilot This was an era when Aer Lingus was expanding into transatlantic flight And so it came to be that at a time when so many Irish people were emigrating across the Irish Sea my grandparents came in the other direction They settled in Howth which was close to Dublin Airport and looked so beautiful from the air They were to raise four daughters there my mother among them Pamela remembered experiencing unexpected culture shock in her new home People in Ireland were far more statusconscious than what she was used to something that continued to surprise her years later She was struck by the authority held by priests and nuns noticing how they were given preferential treatment in public spaces It was expected that that person who happened to be a nun would jump the queue she said The social strata of the London she had come from had been profoundly disrupted by the two World Wars she explained Women were in the workforce people of all backgrounds served together Everybody got mixed up she said The young couple decided to find a local church to attend and after trying out a few settled on Sutton Methodist Church as the one they liked best Pamela was taken aback to discover her children would be attending a different school to their friends next door because the Klimckes were not Catholic I thought that was very sad because youre immediately dividing people up from a very early age she told me They get these fixations about each other Either side they think theyre another species or something School in London was just a school she said Catholics Jews whatever Was it difficult living in Dublin in those days with north London accents Originally no we were just funny strangers who came along and worked for the airline my grandfather remembered But it became a bit different when things got very difficult up in the North In the immediate aftermath of the massacre of unarmed protesters by the British army in Derry on Bloody Sunday my grandmother remembered feeling an atmospheric change in the supermarket when she spoke Its a sensation and you know that suddenly youre the baddy she said There were tensions locally at the time A number of people did get letters saying get out of here and go home my grandfather said We never did and I put that down to Pam Specifically my grandfather believes that the family were accepted because of a fundraiser that Pamela organised It was to raise aid for faminestricken Biafra a breakaway Nigerian province mired in civil war whose aspirations for independence and predominantly Catholic faith had struck a chord of solidarity in Ireland Sponsored walks were a new concept in Ireland Pamela started with Burrow National School the Church of Ireland primary that her children attended Her idea was that all the children of the area could walk together around Howth hill She went down to the priests house in Howth and knocked on the door and talked about this walk she was organising in aid of Biafra The priest took it on completely and all the Catholic schools joined in the march as well my grandfather said It was a very early example of ecumenism he remembered Because of her we werent really seen as quite British half and half or something Acceptable anyway So we never got any threatening letters The Ireland of the time did not have the kind of opportunities for a young mother that Pamela had once dreamed of in London The Marriage Bar that obliged women to leave their jobs upon marriage was in place until along with the cultural beliefs behind it deeply embedded When our family were a wee bit bigger I thought I really would like to do something separate she said It was extremely different Various things I tried Mostly you ended up doing voluntary work because its really what you can do without anyone being overly critical If you were looking for a job if you had children the attitude was what are you doing looking for a job anyway The Methodist church hall in Sutton was to become an important resource a portal to the wider community and in time to the wider world It started with childcare We had the church hall there Somebody said why dont we have something where the children come in for one day and the mothers could go off she said It started very basic and we charged two and six Me and one or two others we brought our own toys down Reaction could be disapproving It wasnt seen as anything that people should be doing she explained Women were there in the home and should be looking after the children Local mothers dropping off their children were encouraged to take turns on the rota an opportunity to learn about how the different activities encouraged childhood development Contraception was not legal in Ireland at the time I remember being with women who were in tears because they had six tiny children the oldest was seven and they just couldnt cope Pamela said She discovered the existence of the Irish Preschool Playgroups Association IPPA and began to attend meetings at St Brigids Day Nursery on Mountjoy Square We were trying to get the government to see that preschool childcare was important They said its nothing to do with us Nobody would claim any responsibility for small children she said They wouldnt acknowledge that some of the mothers might need some help because thats what women do In June the byline Pam Klimcke appeared in  The pitching process had been difficult she told me The query was what is a playgroup she said They thought it was something to do with drama She set out to answer that question under the headline Playing is Learning Each child will be encouraged to talk to move freely from one play area to another perhaps to touch a real spider to water the seedlings or smother paper with thick paint putting colour on colour and so through all these simple pastimes unconsciously learning her article explained A playgroup itself can unite the wider community she continued A cross section of people come together the parents with each other with the public health nurses of the area interested teachers the doctors social workers young people old people can come together united instead of being separate units in the same community Securing and retaining funding from the government was a challenge said an article that ran in  in alongside a piece about early childhood development credited to Pamela Klimcke of the IPPA We set up playgroups in different areas in Ballymun Pamela said So many of those playgroups became private playgroups and then they became expensive The shortage of childcare in north Dublin continues to challenge the ability of her granddaughters to retain paid employment today Pamela was looking out over a river in thendivided Germany about to take a photograph when she noticed a figure in the frame I saw this person right out on the edge on this sort of strip of wood It didnt look very safe she said in an oral history collected by the World Federation of Methodist Women WFMF soon afterwards The woman on the rivers edge was crying You could tell from the attitude of her body Pamela said I waited for her and in fact she was very distressed Between her tears the woman disclosed that she had acted in the past as a person who had helped people come out of Germany escaping from East to West Pamela said She was remembering all sorts of pain She was remembering the pain that she had also experienced through those peoples experiences She shared that with me The encounter happened during Pamelas journey into Potsdam in East Germany for a gathering of the WFMF in a trip that involved passing through Checkpoint Charlie to go beyond the Iron Curtain This was one of the groups international gatherings of Methodist women which Pamela was to attend and sometimes organise holding a series of senior roles in the organisation including editor of its newsletter and president of its Britain and Ireland section Travelling independently she was to attend Methodist church summits in locations as farflung as South Korea Kenya and Brazil as a delegate for Ireland WFMF was a progressive force within Methodism pushing within the Church for greater representation of women the promotion of girls education an end to domestic violence care for the environment and an understanding approach to tackling HIVAIDs In Potsdam local women delegates presented a film they had made expressing their frustrations about gender inequality The Soviet Union had allowed them to take on traditionally male labour roles they outlined but when they came home they were still expected to do all the cooking and childcare work They found that what was meant to be equality was not equality Pamela said Actually the women were doing twice as much as they had before I think that applies not just to Germany She was invited to lunch at the home of a local family and with the help of dictionaries they exchanged all about their lifestyle and introduced Pamela to their children Everything was very restricted Pamela said describing the shortages economic controls and uniformed Russian soldiers who were never far away It was the first time I would have met women from that part of Europe and it was difficult to share verbally There was lots of hugging she said Sometimes you dont need the language A few months later the Berlin Wall fell Back in Ireland she was to make her biggest splash the same year when she was invited to speak at the Glenstal Ecumenical Conference an interdenominational gathering aimed to bring the Irish churches together The topic was the ordination of women an issue of contested debate in the Church of Ireland at the time After interventions from a theologian a priest and a prominent Dominican nun Pamela gave a speech arguing in favour I quoted from all sorts of sources including the Bible of course Methodists had long had women ministers so supporting ordination seemed like the obvious thing to me she explained I thought it was the normal thing She remembered her shock when as the interventions concluded journalists seemed to swarm towards her She hadnt realised her comments would be newsworthy I was quoted on the radio and also on the TV When we spoke my grandmother revealed she had recently caused a stir in the local post office by producing a bulky envelope addressed to the Pope She had sent Pope Francis a copy of the speech she had given all those years ago arguing for the ordination of women which had later been published in a church magazine Because it dawned on me its years she said Nothing in that respect has changed Now it was a very polite letter and I was very careful in how I worded it But I sent the magazine to the Pope You have to start at the top you know My grandparents were deeply disturbed by recent political events They were horrified by Brexit I think its a detachment from Europe which to a degree and hopefully it will never happen has meant that the kind of conflicts that we lived through and our families lived through are more likely to come back again my grandfather told me after the vote Pamela saw it similarly We lived through war periods and our families have been involved in wars over those generations in memory It just struck us that this wasnt taken into account at all she told me I think youve got to come together you have to see what you have in common and to my mind it was a disaster When Russia invaded Ukraine on February this year it brought back vivid and disturbing memories for them Amid the exchange of photographs of greatgrandchildren reaching milestones on the family WhatsApp Pamela and Raymond shared their distress Has Europe been down the Munich road my grandfather wrote on the day of the invasion referring to the appeasement of Adolf Hitler before the second World War After Ukraine Estonia Latvia Lithuania He despaired of the ability of the West to meet the challenge What chance against Russia he wrote Its terrible to see all the human stories unfold again and to feel helpless Pamela shared a viral appeal for everyone to switch off their lights in the house showing Putin wed rather sit in the dark than buy his gas All too familiar and so horrific I remember my mother saying that before the war began in she felt the war was inevitable she wrote My father thought differently trusting that it would be sorted out by talking Sadly he was wrong I cannot express how I feel looking at another dictator who has become obsessed with his own power Yvonne saw the images of fleeing Ukrainian children and remembered her own evacuation I look at the children in Ukraine and I see their faces Youve had a lovely little comfortable life And all of a sudden people are worried and theyre taking you somewhere else she told me You feel bewildered One weekend in May Pamela had dinner to celebrate her birthday with Raymond and my parents at a hotel in Wicklow The next morning at breakfast she fell to the floor The stroke had taken her consciousness

brain when spoken words no longer can It may seem strange to say of a man nearing but when I saw my grandfather for the first time he looked old At Pamelas funeral he spoke of her rich life and the artistic talents she had passed down to their children and grandchildren in his eulogy She loved colour She loved flowers She loved the garden She painted lovely pictures and made lovely clothes my grandfather said He described her tireless community work The time and involvement she applied to those roles was endless She also did an art degree parttime Im immensely proud of her Pamela Klimcke

altarpiece with an embroidered white dove carrying in its beak a St Brigids Cross The cross was a gift from a neighbouring Catholic church given in the wake of the Enniskillen Remembrance Day bombing Pamela had sewn it into the doves beak Before she died my grandparents had made efforts to claim Irish citizenship but were defeated by the paperwork required to prove their long years of residency

401,../data/sec_IRL/Irish Times/Factiva-20230807-170,Saturday Magazine Ritual reboot Ireland’s relationship with ritual has changed immensely Old ways of commemoration and connection are disappearing but what replaces them Three creators share some new rituals they have made for themselves and others Wörter Februar      At this time of year the word ritual is bandied about a lot most often by advertisers in an attempt to flog skincare products or gym equipment But genuine rituals are incredibly important to human beings psychologically emotionally and spiritually Though commonly confused with repetitive actions that are routine a ritual is container around a moment that encourages us to be mindful that can promote transformation and that fosters a connection to a force bigger than oneself such as nature love God or humanity itself Irelands relationship with ritual has transformed over the past decade the number of Irish people attending Catholic Mass is declining and many people are holding Humanist or secular ceremonies for weddings and funerals Covid disrupted our relationship with ritual even further as we mourned people over Zoom and werent able to gather together and celebrate new births and new love The loss we felt illustrated how much we rely on rituals to let us gather witness and reflect The rising popularity of tools and practices such as sage yoga and cacao ceremonies show that our appetite for connection and ritual persists but often these practices remain individualistic consumerist or appropriative How can we create rituals that foster connection and community and offer us meaningful ways of understanding ourselves and each other Here three ritual creators designers and innovators share how rituals can be embraced for experiences that fall outside of the traditional remit of weddings births and deaths Kathy Scott The Trailblazery Kathy Scott is director of The Trailblazery which designs and produces live events learning experiences and communal rituals Scott believes rituals are methods of meaningmaking often rooted in a desire for transformation and healing Were in this whole series of interlocking crises she says Of course theres the climate crisis but its also the last roars of late stage capitalism consumerism technology Theyre all interlocking crises showing us that these systems are falling apart And I think what communal ritual can bring to that is a sense of trying to find our way communally through this Its about paying attention to the fact that things have stopped working and pausing and trying to seek how we can crawl out of this With a strong interest in how human beings relate to the earth and their native lands Scott encourages Irish people to look to our islands history and reclaim Celtic rituals and traditions One way to do this is to resist the ubiquitous calls for selfimprovement transformation and gym memberships that plague us all at this time of year We have inherited chronological time from the Romans right the Gregorian calendar which has no meaning says Scott But the calendar that we were bequeathed from the ancients that Celtic tradition embraces is a calendar with eight festivals its about deep ecological geological time Its about circle time like cycles and seasons and observing the rhythm of the earth The Gregorian calendar combined with this consumerist monster demands that we get up and join a gym on the first of January but if were actually observing whats happening in nature were still in deep hibernation Were only really meant to come out of that on Imbolc which marks the start of spring Also known as St Brigids Day Imbolc will now be marked with a bank holiday for the first time this Monday February giving people in Ireland the perfect opportunity to create new rituals around renewals awakenings and fresh starts she believes For anyone who finds the idea of creating a new ritual intimidating Scott encourages them to start small this spring Id always say to people to get out into nature even if its just to moving water for Imbolc visiting a river or a well to honour Bridget and all that she represents I think the new popularity of sea swimming is magnificent Its also amazing for trauma and resilience that cold immersion If the temperatures are still too cold for a dip Scott suggests starting a gratitude practice Its just transformational I know it sounds vague and of course everything has been hijacked by Hallmark you can spend loads buying a fancy gratitude journal but just write down three things you are grateful for No matter whats going on in your life theres something that will happen alchemically that will start to change your whole frequency The heart starts to become activated The Trailblazery also runs women focused events called Moon Medicine which have proven wildly successful meeting once a month on Zoom around the time of the full moon Scott cites the Waking The Feminists movement Donald Trumps election the Belfast rape trial the MeToo movement and even the discourse around the Mother and Baby Homes as tipping points that led many Irish women seek out ways to grieve heal and connect in safe spaces The moon circles include yoga meditation music discussions and workshops with luminaries writers teachers leaders and practitioners from different cultures ethnicities and communities In an Irish context there was so much wounding that we needed to sit with she says of the first meetings And we just crawled our way through So it was always a response Sometimes over people will come they are huge Scott notes that while many people feel a physiological emotional and spiritual need for ritual in modern life it is still mostly women who are creating or attending these communal spaces Scott praises musician Damien Dempsey whose concerts and recent documentary Love Yourself Today encourage men to engage in rituals of connection and expression But Scott believes theres a need for more ritual work that specifically caters to the needs of men Ive been lucky enough to work with some men who are starting to lead those movements but compared to the options for women they are thin on the ground she says I think thats because of the compression of the trauma of the patriarchy on men But the needle is moving in the right direction Theres a beautiful aspect of ritual that connects us to our ancestors and those who are yet to come as well In a way youre practising for generations you might never meet And to me theres something very beautiful about that thetrailblazerycom Tiu De Haan The ideal doula Londonbased ritual designer Tiu De Haan also known as an ideal doula has spent her career studying different types of rituals across cultures exploring how they can connect us to ourselves She explains that her work is about the creation of a sacred experience of a moment of meaning for reflection emotion transition and celebration De Haan offers personal development experiences that embrace ritual and holds online courses each January that help individuals reflect on the year passed and think mindfully about what kind of year they want to create But her speciality is designing ceremonies that address individuals unique emotional needs One example cited in her TED Talk Why We Still Need Ritual was focused on the needs of a twoyearold boy whose father had died very suddenly The mum on Fathers Day wanted to have a ceremony where she could bring seven godfathers to come and be the male role models for this little boy as he was growing up she explains So she brought a little slide set it up in a park in a circle of trees And each of the seven men came took the boy by the hand and helped him climb the steps and ad he came down the slide they made their vow whatever it was One promised he would come and play with him every other weekend Another promised When youre Ill take you for your first drink and take you to your first football match It didnt matter what the promise was the ceremony was what gave the role models space to give him their love and their time Some forms of loss are more ambiguous than a bereavement and the lack of recognition around these experiences can make them harder to process A woman client of De Haans was amicably divorced when her exhusband suffered a severe head injury The injury resulted in a complete personality shift The woman and her adult children struggled to process this transformation and the loss of the person they had known and loved There was no funeral obviously because he hadnt died says De Haan But then there was no way of showing the grief for the person that had gone De Haan helped the family to create a ritual to process their feelings Our first session was me and her and her kids all cocreating a ritual that he was never told about and will never be told about which was to be done on the anniversary of the accident that was about them memorialising the dad and the exhusband who was no longer there The ceremony involved sharing memories writing letters to their father and reading them aloud before burning them The ritual De Haan notes was deeply healing and made it easier for the family to accept and embrace the new version of this person Its about asking how do I have a ceremony to let go of this person whos not dead but who has changed It wasnt for him it was for them Some rituals address the timeless universal experiences like loss love and death But we also need ways to acknowledge new experiences only made possible by recent advances in technology De Haan was asked by Moorefields Eye Hospital in London to create a ceremony where the families of people who have died and donated their corneas meet the people who can see as a result Just imagine that Theres never before been a precedent for that Its a completely century ritual but its an ancient human need to honour life and love and death Another modern example comes from advances in reproductive technology where women who have had eggs or embryos frozen decide to no longer keep them effectively shutting the door on one potential pathway in life What do you do about your frozen eggs if thats a very particular experience that has never been ritualised asks De Haan New rituals often come from a sudden recognition that there is something that has not been addressed tiudehaancom Hugh Farrell Listen Breathe Writer dramaturge and producer Hugh Farrell works across theatre opera music and the visual arts and is the cofounder of the company Listen Breathe Farrell enjoys creating blended reality experiences to explore how we interact with ourselves each other and our environment and much of the work that he produces grapples with the idea of ritual One production Feast Every Year I Grow Again is an augmentedreality dining experience designed in collaboration with Michelinstar chef Kevin Thornton With Feast we actually get people to sit around the dinner table and eat dinner together with headphones Farrell explains We slow down the ritual of eating together so that we can look at that experience for what it is Food has become so abstract in our lives Food has become convenient we tend to eat it quickly alone on the run We tend not to think about where it comes from or that what were eating is actually becoming us or the relationship between what is on dinner table to the farmer So Feast is about trying to bring people together and witnessing all those connections both in the ritual of the meal together but also the relationship of the food to its wider context Dublinborn Farrell left the church as a teenager As an adult he embraces Eastern mysticism yoga and meditation But he always remained aware of the important role Catholic mass has played in Irish life and the spiritual and emotional vacuum that is often left for those who stop attending Theres something really important in mass literally the word like amassing together where communities come together once a week to rest to see each other to be seen I think its really important to be seen in your day its healing And we have a crisis of loneliness in the country that was exacerbated by the pandemic So a really important part of Listen Breathe shows is all about meeting in public and seeing each other and then going on a journey together I see theatre as being founded in ritual One of Farrells projects subverted a traditional Catholic ritual Confession Along with schoolfriend Shane Sugrue of Qualified Design Studio Farrell worked on Without Sin an immersive theatre experience that featured at the Dublin Fringe Festival Without Sin consisted of black box that sat in the grounds of Dublin Castle Two individuals were invited to enter the box finding themselves in their own small confessional booth separated by a wall Unable to see each other and communicating via a microphone and headphones the participants were invited to select personal questions from a deck of cards and have an open and honest conversation as soft lights and music created a reflective atmosphere Shane identified that in the idea of the Confession box theres a real therapeutic power of getting something off your chest says Farrell But theres a problem in the idea of the Confession box where youre absolved you dont actually do any of the work that you need to do Also its hugely built around moralistic shame So what we tried to do was take that typology of the Confession box which is familiar to everyone and reframe it and try to get shame out of the box We wanted instead to create an open hearted dialogue between two people as an act of healing and to let participants know that whatever youre carrying around with you youre not alone Its about feeling seen or heard We dont have a lot of space for that in our in our culture I tell Farrell that I participated in Without Sin on its final night in the Fringe Festival and had a beautifully vulnerable conversation with a stranger in the dark As we both exited the box after our experience we instinctively hugged a reaction Farrell says is common That moment of connection is flipping the framework of the confessional booth where you go in and you just exit alone and theres no connection with the authority figure on the other side But here people often hug he laughs Or when people who knew each other already go in we often found that they walked off holding hands and just kind of like squeezing each others hands a little more it was really beautiful It was like they said something that they hadnt been able to say or didnt realise they needed to say listenandbreathelive l

with the Rev John Harris OP celebrating Mass in the private diningroom for Oireachtas members and staff Its goodbye to the sweet stuff for days now tweeted Senator Rónán Mullen threatening an exceptionally vicious edge to his Seanad contributions for the next six weeks or so Either that or he is counting down the hours until he can attack one of those creme eggs in handknitted eggcosies that he sells for charity every Easter Things went downhill from there The media could talk about nothing but drugs after Sinn Féins Dessie Ellis told the Dáil the night before that cocaine use was rife in all areas of Irish society Its even in Dáil Éireann Then the excitement brought on by the prospect of asking random politicians did you ever do drugs was overtaken at lunchtime by news of a double resignation at the top of the Social Democrats That drugs wheeze ran out of steam by Thursday morning when journalists were reduced to asking Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys who used to play the organ in her local Presbyterian church in Monaghan if she wanted to fess up to any other piperelated activities The unexpected resignations of Soc Dems coleaders Róisín Shortall and Catherine Murphy would have been the highlight of Hash Wednesday had it not been for the unexpected arrival of a fully costumed pirate in Leinster House after the dust settled on the twin departures With multiple votes taking place and a lot of visitors about the place it was busy around the corridors and in the bar Neasa Hourigan the Green TD for Dublin Central hosted a constituency branch meeting on the premises and members went on a guided tour of Leinster House afterwards As the group walked quietly around the old building passersby stopped in their tracks and did a doubletake when they copped a man dressed in a full pirate rigout in the middle of them We hear an openmouthed Michael McDowell almost walked into a wall The mysterious buccaneer weighed anchor in the Dáil bar along with the rest of Hourigans guests The joint was already hopping as most of the Social Democrats a large cast and crew had decamped to the bar soon after the late afternoon announcement It was an emotional and tiring occasion for them with some a little more tired and emotional than others as the night wore on They were ensconced in an area inside the main door while at the far end former Labour Party leaders Brendan Howlin and Alan Kelly were deep in conversation triggered and retraumatised by Catherine and Róisíns resignations Further up again was Hourigan and Green Party MEP Ciaran Cuffe The latter had a long conversation with the pirate who goes by the name of Sting Hammersley Hamish and lives in Dublin He was able to tell him about his MEP colleagues from the Czech Republic who are members of the Pirate Party and part of the wider GreensEuropean Free Alliance grouping in the European Parliament With his leather slouch boots breeches swashbuckling patterned shirt and dashing feathered hat the pirate was the centre of attention He spent a long time talking to Sinn Féins David Cullinane Hes a unique chap and a really really nice guy said Neasa Hourigan He is a free thinker The pirate Sting that is not David Cullinane There was no parrot not even a stuffed one Speaking of parrots the parliamentary party meetings were still ongoing when the Dublin Green Party pirate made his entrance into the Visitors Bar Fianna Fáils meeting was very poorly attended We met one backbench TD on his way back into Leinster House Sure there was hardly anyone at the parliamentary party meeting We were all over beyond in the Shelbourne Hotel at the launch of Bertie Aherns podcast thingy with talk This is true Honest to God youd never believe Pat Kenny is Theres Bertie Im saying nuttin The TD didnt race off to catch the tailend of the meeting Instead he rushed towards the bar because somebody texted him to come in Did you hear anything about a pirate He says the Greens have a fella in there dressed as a pirate A rake of Fine Gaelers also called down for a look after their parliamentary party meeting dragged on forever They were very pleased with the costofliving package unveiled during the week and they were also very pleased with media performances by Paschal Donohoe and Jennifer Carroll MacNeill in the aftermath Kilkenny TD John Paul Phelan to noisy agreement praised Donohoe for seeing off Sinn Féins Pearse Doherty during a combative Prime Time confrontation while his observation that Carroll MacNeill did such a good job against Shortall on Drivetime that she quit today was equally well received Charlies polished grapes Another milestone for women in Leinster House yesterday with the news that catering powerhouse Julie Lyons above left has been appointed head chef the first woman to hold the position in Oireachtas history Lyons has been a fixture in Kildare Street for more than years and is now cooking for her eighth Taoiseach She began working in the newly renovated Government Buildings in when then taoiseach Charlie Haughey was expanding its capacity for entertaining and fine dining She catered for events in his Abbeville mansion in north Co Dublin He used to give us £ as a tip which was a lot in those days and hed always come in to personally to hand it to us She also provided meals for him when he was travelling to Inishvickillane his private island off the coast of Kerry However Lyons had to prepare the food on the mainland as she was not allowed on to the island Instead a male chef was flown across by helicopter She came out with a startling revelation in a radio interview a number of years ago when Ryan Tubridy asked her about her time working for Haughey He liked his grapes polished It seems he was very fussy We would have polished the grapes anyway but Charlie was very particular and he would actually come in to check that they were shiny Over the years Lyons has been central to all the big and not so big events in Leinster House devising menus and creating dishes behind the scenes while continuing as an engaging frontofhouse presence for all She has a page to herself on the Oireachtas website Before getting the job of head chef in Leinster House she was kitchen manager This is one for the girls Were all so delighted and proud of Julie Even through the worst of Covid she kept the catering operation going said Donna Finglas a longtime member of the restaurant team The Ceann Comhairle was thrilled Julie has been a friend and a member of staff for many many years and she has been superb and outstanding at her job Shes always been an innovator and shes done things that others wouldnt have tried including polishing Mr Haugheys grapes Its a role she should have occupied long before now because her abilities are known to all of us not least her ability to work with other people and bring out the best in them Its great to see a woman in that job at long last Finian has the itch Soft old lefties that they are former ministers in the last government Finian McGrath and John Halligan just cant leave politics behind Halligan and McGrath were in Leinster House again this week this time following a visit to the Cuban embassy where they met ambassador Bernardo Guanche Hernández The last gig I did as a minister was when I represented Ireland in Havana for St Patricks Day McGrath tells us We are trying to lobby the Irish Government to develop relationships with Cuba because they are being hammered at the moment by the US blockade We also discussed agriculture and education and health and disabilities because they have some excellent ideas on social care It seems the pair didnt leave the embassy emptyhanded as his excellency presented them with some very fine Cuban cigars McGrath was none too pleased when Halligan held on to his stash despite being a nonsmoker Meanwhile Fine Gael TD for Mayo Michael Ring ran into McGrath in Leinster House car park Ill tell ya one thing the Ringer told us afterwards I think he has something in his head I have that feeling Its either going to be the Dáil or Europe for Finian I can see the itch in him again Election speculation Speaking of running for election Leinster House is gearing up for the next big one We hear there is a lot of talk in Government circles about cutting and running to the country sooner rather than later A rapidly approaching general election was being posited as one of the reasons that Shortall and Murphy announced their resignations Why would we wait until after next years local elections when we know Sinn Féin will massively improve on their performance the last time when the party had a nightmare The same goes for the European elections said one experienced TD as the Soc Dems spoke about getting a new leader in place as soon as possible Deliver a good budget at the end of this year and wheres the incentive to hang on until the benefits are forgotten Well be on the trail again much sooner than you think Early next year perhaps when the weather heats up a little is the most favoured prediction A striking comparison Labours Ged Nash took to the plinth on Tuesday morning with colleagues Ivana Bacik and Annie Hoey to give the Labour Partys verdict on the Governments costofliving supports They were as well targeted as a Darwin Nunez shot from outside the box

UUPs real allies lie not in the DUP but in SDLP and Alliance ITS time for oncebig parties to reconsider their positions It used to be that we did not talk of the Ulster Unionist Party There was briefly a time when it was the Official Unionist Party and a brief spell in which it was UCUNF the Ulster Conservative and Unionist New Force But for a long time it was just the Unionist Party a monolithic representation of the commitment to the Union in Northern Ireland aided by the occasional independent unionist but solid and big and unassailable It was a bit plummy back then People who have not heard the voice of Captain Terence ONeill once leader of that party and prime minister of Northern Ireland should search for him on YouTube and marvel that an electorate was ever impressed by someone who spoke in mannered tones that few of us ever encountered in real life Doug Beattie would never have survived in that party Brian Faulkner was a bit plummy too but his son Michael assures me that though he was a good impersonator Colombo was one of his party pieces his broadcast voice was natural to him And anyway his contemporaries Ted Heath in Westminster and Jack Lynch in the Dail were also a little affected Then along came Rev Ian Paisley to challenge the Unionist Party as he challenged the Presbyterian Church and the Orange Order establishing alternative bodies to all three and making himself the head of the Democratic Unionist Party the Free Presbyterian Church and the Independent Orange Order And this brought plain speaking into politics From then on politicians sought to get votes from workingclass people not by dazzling them with their demeanour but by sounding just like them Today the Ulster Unionist Party finds itself having to pick a new leader in time for the next Assembly elections which they must hope will not be brought forward by any political deadlock triggered by changes at the top of the DUP Doug Beattie is the obvious choice but he has already evaded the opportunity twice once deferring to Robin Swann who then decided he didnt want the job only to find himself with the much bigger challenge of steering the health service through a pandemic and once to Steve Aiken who now doesnt feel up to it One of Beatties assets is that he can handle himself against Stephen Nolan The UUs face a difficulty similar to that of Labour How do they distinguish themselves from rivals They present themselves as an alternative to the DUP They are now the nice liberal unionists not quite secular but unionist reverential towards the crown and the imperial tradition which as John Hume should have said you cant eat But when elections come round they come under pressure to maximise the unionist vote and step forward as allies rather than rivals of the TUV and the DUP against notable threats to the Union like the Alliance Party and the SDLP As if the dreaded eclipsing of those parties would be the same as the weakening of the Union It wouldnt Saving the Union is not the same project as saving unionist parties Indeed the two distinct projects might work against each other This fact has already sunk in with Arlene Foster and Peter Robinson and even Gregory Campbell judging by a recent performance on the Claire Byrne Show on RTE They have all claimed that they believe the Union is safe because many people who do not vote for unionist parties will vote against a united Ireland Indeed if the Union depended on the unionist parties it would be in immediate jeopardy because those parties have little prospect of preserving the majority of seats in the Assembly And the DUP deluded by the fear that it needs to consolidate around its traditional values is likely to shrink I have heard Church people say that in a time of secularisation it is better to have a smaller more committed Church than a big dilute one Preserving the pure message is what counts most It doesnt work that way in politics There is a large section of the population which loves the Union wants to declare that love and fly the flag wants to show love for the Queen and honour the armed forces Fine If you are a unionist fighting for the Union you dont have to worry about those people They are onside already So organising your political and cultural mission around their concerns is a waste of energy Yes of course you must respect them and employ them but you cant let them alienate others that you need onside too And if thousands of people are amenable to voting for the Union but will never vote for a unionist party you have to ask yourself what you can do to at least keep them thinking that way You certainly dont want to alienate them But a political party that promotes the Union only among the committed is a failure It is just talking to itself Worse it is often telling the small u unionists that it doesnt actually want them Thats what they do when they join efforts to maximise votes for unionist parties and align with the DUP and even the TUV Why should the Ulster Unionist Party care whether other parties succeed or fail Pulling together just gives unionism a bad name reaffirms that it is ethnic confirms soft nationalists in a suspicion that they are better off without them and better off outside the Union Or at least persuades them that the argument for the Union coming from that quarter is not the one to listen to If I was the leader of the UUs I would see my closest political allies as the dontmentionit quasiunionists of the SDLP and the Alliance Party I do not imagine that a dinner party with Doug Beattie Claire Hanna and Naomi Long would break up in acrimony Unfortunately even in wellrun democratic systems parties compete most fiercely against other parties which are most similar to them Therefore it makes more sense for likeminded parties to merge and one day perhaps that logic will force our middle ground parties to coalesce I would die happy if that happened Of course it would have to be explained to the core base why the party is not trying to outdo the DUP in flagwaving but perhaps there is a natural division of the unionist parties which is long overdue with the chauvinists going one way and the secular realists the other

Media Northern Ireland ITS no wonder theres a lack of confidence in unionism Its leading political party tearing itself apart in public hasnt lifted that communitys spirits But this embattled selfimage has been taking a battering for decades In popular culture unionism is The Baddie Over halfacentury of pop music and film its the nationalist perspective that is the natural lens through which Northern Ireland is seen Unionism has never been sexy In the popular imagination unionists are dour stubborn backwardlooking uneasy with the modern world wary of fancy talk and the imagination When media around the globe want to illustrate an Ulster Prod they reach for a stock image of an old man in a bowler hat with a speech bubble saying just one word No Given that stereotyping whod raise their hand and say Thats me It hasnt helped that among the several characteristics of unionism and Protestantism also is a propensity to assume they have been betrayed and to follow this up with division Lundys down the decades have encompassed everyone from the lowliest individual courting a Catholic to the Prime Minister and the current heir to the throne Theres a strange comfort to be derived from being both pure and lonely to having remained true while everyone else walked away In general nationalism is a simpler idea and one which retains adherents across the classes regardless of economic ambition the starterpack for Irish Catholics contains a united Ireland the way bicycle repair kits used to have a tube of glue and wee rubber patches But it would be a mistake for anyone now to assume that religion or community will guarantee a particular vote Elections in the teach us that people with more information at their fingertips than ever are no longer predictable Labour in Britain for all its dominance of social media and street activism on a range of issues hasnt had a sniff of power in years It used to be a view of nationalists that eventually Protestants would come to realise that Britain wasnt their friend That hasnt happened and shows no sign of happening This is a problem because the number of people who still do not want to be subsumed into some unitary state remains very sizeable At least with nationalism unity remained an aspiration For unionists a united Ireland would be a permanent state irrevocable and irreversible In this context the Union becomes more attractive when it seems most at risk But while nationalists are confident about proclaiming their politics ordinary unionists squirm in embarrassment at how they are poisonously caricatured and dont want their politics made public Which is a shame because silence only allows those crude stereotypes to flourish Of course the unionist community is much more diverse as compellingly illustrated by Susan McKays new book Northern Protestants On Shifting Ground Interviewees include an ex RUC man who feels let down by the Belfast Agreement and doesnt vote poet Jean Bleakney who felt similarly betrayed so voted DUP for the first time and ex DUP MLA Sammy Douglas talking about his gay daughter Anton tells McKay about growing up in London and attending Harrow His late granny had a farm in Ballycastle and sold secondhand clothing to raise funds for the Presbyterian Church Anton was fascinated by one customer whom he believed was transgender She grew up in a really poor family of girls and the official story is that they didnt have enough clothes to clothe the only boy so he wore the girls clothes But she continued wearing them and became SAMMARYANN a woman Whatever the reason for SamMaRYANNs attire its a quietly moving vignette of acceptance Evidently Anton whos gay is also seeking that among people he feels are his own At Queens University he attended DUP and LGBT events and was thran at both The LGBT community was antichurch and the DUP was antiLGBT and I used to argue against what the orthodoxy was He details an extraordinary encounter with Orangemen in south Armagh The locals quickly realise Anton and his partner are gay and attempt to intimidate them But when Anton talks of his grandfathers Orange sash prejudices fall away and some let us see the humanity in them The diversity of Protestant worship is a recurring theme Farmer Tom Forgrave and wife Anna lost huge sums after investing in the RHI scheme They now feel estranged from the state and no longer vote Theyre Reformed Presbyterians who dont believe in secret societies so dont join the Loyal Orders Colin Davidson famous for his portraits including those of the Queen and Seamus Heaney recalls growing up in a Christian family but soon struggled to find an identity within any Church He also had a definite sense of being Irish I didnt feel British He became absorbed in Irish culture but feels there needs to be a realisation that the Irish language which I love with all my heart and the emblems of Irishness were used as a weapons in a psychological war against the community I grew up in there are thousands of people in our community still struck with fear when they see an Irish flag or read the Irish language because it was associated with terror and war and killing and death These arent comments to be taken lightly and they arent the more serious because they come from a distinguished person as opposed to the many ordinary thousands who have more harrowing tales of injury and loss Take the number of Catholics who served in the RUC and Prison Service for example If ever there were rebels Catholic RUC officers fit the bill indeed something that still applies to Catholics in the PSNI having to be discreet about how they earn a living One thing is sure The old opposites of Union and United Ireland cannot still be considered viable What needs focused on especially postpandemic are those things we have experienced so little of here consistency growth neighbourliness familiarity At least for a decade lets see what kind of a go can be made of this economy and this old zone of contention Lets give at least one generation a proper chance to flourish without gunshots and threat Boris Johnson found that the Labour electorate in the north of England were prepared to lend him their vote after generations of opposition Never was a man more aware of the consequences of what that loan means The challenge for unionism today is to make a similar appeal to liberals nationalists trade unionists unemployed Catholic and Protestant and those of no attachment alike Its about persuading people to lend their consent to stability and seeing what happens We might all be surprised

424,../data/sec_IRL/Belfast Telegraph/Factiva-20230807-170, Dont bottle it up we are here to listen whatever youre going through Wörter August   National   Independent  Media Northern Ireland The Samaritans are soon to mark years since the first Northern Ireland branch began Noel McAdam looks at the importance of the helpline THROUGH all the years of the Troubles Samaritan volunteers in Belfast were forced to leave their phones just once It was in when the Army insisted they vacate their then headquarters on Stranmillis Road because of a nearby bomb alert Samaritans Director at the time the Rev Sydney Callaghan remembered The office was only left unmanned for about two hours A bomb had been left nearby but staff left under protest Now the Belfast branch is about to celebrate the anniversary of its formation The impetus came from a North Down woman Lorna Connor after she sat in her living room watching a television programme called Share the Load about the Samaritans At first it was not very easy to find enough people interested but we got members from various denominations together and so the Samaritans organisation was formed the Holywood woman said Belfast was the branch to open in the UK but quickly became the fourth busiest in Britain and Ireland In the first four years there were clients And the man who had founded the organisation eight years earlier in London the Rev Chad Varah was an early visitor He said The volunteers who will be offering this friendship here will be directed by representatives of the Church of Ireland Presbyterian Catholic and Methodist Churches This kind of cooperation is pretty rare anywhere and I think remarkable in Northern Ireland In his later book on the organisation called The Samaritans Constable London Mr Varah said the Belfast success was a great triumph for the Samaritan idea in a city where religious conflicts were often so violent By the end of the first decade with the Troubles taking hold branches had spread to Ballymena Bangor Craigavon Coleraine Londonderry Newry and Omagh And as times progressed the organisation became regularly used by the paramilitaries as a conduit to deliver their bomb alerts placing Samaritans in an invidious position For example given the confidentiality guarantee at the heart of how Samaritans works one terror gang passed on details of the location of where they had murdered and dumped a mans body Those calls caused us some considerable agony We dont really know if we should take them but we are doing a public service the Rev Callaghan said Immediately we receive the information we pass it on to the police but it usually leaves the person taking the call very distressed But the people who ring us up know they are not going to be taped Callaghan himself wasnt entirely convinced the Samaritans would prove necessary in such a closeknit society as Northern Ireland As a Methodist Minister working on the Shankill he also came up against the hard edge of sectarianism His misgivings were underpinned when he admitted in a  newspaper interview in that a Samaritans volunteer a man in his told him he had never met a Protestant socially until joining the organisation It was one of the saddest things I ever heard he said But sectarianism wasnt to the fore in most of the phone calls the branches were taking It was broken relationships loneliness people addicted to drugs alcohol and gambling as well as homosexuals or transvestites And suicide was not always the focus either even if callers were often depressed Before long the list of issues being presented included agoraphobiacs those with a fear of open spaces and the opposite claustrophobiacs Sedatives and relaxants as antidepression pills were sometimes called at the time were prevalent for the Belfast branch The city had a higher rate of people on such tablets than any comparable city in the United Kingdom A article reports one caller who thought he was made of glass and had to take special care getting off buses Another thought he was the victim of a worldwide FBI plot Neither was turned away Listening remains at the heart of what Samaritans do Volunteers make no judgement about the callers and will not provide advice Niall Mulligan executive director of Samaritans Ireland said We are a lifeline for those who have nowhere else to turn supporting more and more people every year After the move to Stranmillis the Belfast branch base became known as Thomson House in honour of the first director Presbyterian Minister Dr William Thomson who first clearly set out the ethos at its core We dont judge or condemn or scold We befriend the people who come to us We dont try to be amateur psychologists or lawyers If people want professional advice we tell them where they can get it he said The majority of our callers are not suicidal he said although the Samaritans tag line in their advertising and on flyers at the time was for the suicidal and despairing Callers were usually asked if they had suicidal feelings which is not the case today There are people who just opt out of the life who drift through lodging houses and finally become unemployable There are people in Belfast who sleep out all the time he went on The very first premises in Belfast where in King Street three rooms at the top of what appeared to be endless flights of stairs In the earlier years as they moved from an ordinary house Lisburn Road to corner offices in Stranmillis and now its base in Wellesley Avenue branches here dealt solely with local calls but the phone network is now nationwide So someone calling from Broughshane at is as likely to have their call picked up in Brighton or Birmingham as Belfast For a long time into the early there were more female than male volunteers but more men than women were calling and from all types of social and educational backgrounds Nowadays there are an average calls to branches north and south of the border every day The Belfast branch is also involved in outreach work recently involving government departments in the province Veteran volunteer Ken Bamford says around civil servants attended two sessions including Wellbeing in the Workplace shortly before the pandemic The virus has brought its own challenges with a drop in volunteer numbers due to selfisolation and shielding which impacted on many branches other volunteers taking on additional shifts every week Samaritans also increased efforts to place banners and signage at strategic points across Belfast and beyond As part of outreach City Hall has also lit up in orange over the last two years to mark World Suicide Day on September The organisation has also teamed up with local libraries for Brew Monday a spin on Blue Monday which has been called the saddest day of the year the third Monday in January when library users are met with a cuppa and the chance for a chat From here we can hopefully build with talks health fairs school visits and information evenings to recruit more volunteers Mr Bamford who also leads fundraising efforts added The proportion of people who call at the door dramatically reduced even before Covid so the main function remains manning the phones In general when people ring Samaritans for emotional support they often mention isolation and loneliness anxiousness and mental health as well as family and relationship issues Mr Mulligan added Even with restrictions easing we are quite aware that many people face an uncertain future and some will be concerned about losing their jobs and their businesses Others may be facing challenging financial circumstances Our key message is that if youre struggling with the impact of if life is difficult and youre feeling anxious stressed or unable to cope dont bottle it up dont struggle through it alone We are here to listen whatever youre going through Samaritans can be contacted on Freephone We are aware people face an uncertain future

427,../data/sec_IRL/Belfast Telegraph/Factiva-20230807-170, A trip to West Cork taught me how much we have in common Alf McCreary Wörter September   National   Independent  Media Northern Ireland T HIS year I went on holiday across the Irish border to escape from our stultifying northern politics but I soon found myself being overtaken by the hand of history Our accommodation in West Cork was a former Church of Ireland rectory on a site reputed to date from and in nearby Kinsale there were vivid reminders of King William of Orange and his fatherinlaw King James II who fled from Ireland after his trouncing at the Boyne My former history teacher at Queens University the legendary Professor JC Beckett was fond of telling us that the most difficult barrier in Ireland is the border in peoples minds and sadly our rich and troubled history is indeed kept alive with the freshness of each new morning As I drove south I admired the beautiful scenery on a hot summer day on my way to Cork However I could not help thinking of the northern Gaelic chieftains who marched their followers down through Ireland in the depths of winter to the illfated Battle of Kinsale of where the English triumphed over the native Irish This led eventually to the Flight of the Earls who became ghostly shadows from a lost world The defeat at Kinsale paved the way for the divisive Plantation in the north and unfortunately we have been grappling with the enormous repercussions of this ever since However the ancient slaughter of Kinsale seemed buried in the undergrowth of history as we drove into the town Kinsale at the best of times is beautiful and in the heatwave it looked like Cannes with its large marina I had booked our guest house west of Kinsale with no idea of its long history However I could not suppress a wry smile when our hostess said that the original rectory on this site was built in a date imbedded in the DNA of many northerners Beyond the rosefilled garden in front of the former rectory there is the small Anglican church of Ballinadee which apparently is nearly years old and I thought that if its walls could talk what a story they would tell Later I visited once again the St Multose Anglican church in Kinsale dating from It is named after a saint who founded a monastery there in the sixth century One resplendent memorial in the church is the coat of arms of King William III accompanied by the statement explaining that it was set here after when the Duke of Marlborough captured Kinsale from the forces of King James II The coat of arms was originally above the seat of the Sovereign or chief magistrate of Kinsale There was a feeling of deja vu about driving some miles from north Belfast to West Cork and to find such a memorial to King Billy in a Protestant church in Kinsale It seemed as if we cannot escape from the hand of history that looms over us Outside the church I spotted the graves to two local men who died when the Lusitania the Cunard liner was torpedoed by a German Uboat off the Old Head of Kinsale in with the loss of nearly lives including women and children In turn that made me think of Cobh not far from Kinsale where there is a memorial to the Titanic which visited the port then called Queenstown This strong connection between Belfast which built the Titanic and Cobh where she stopped briefly before sailing into history is sometimes conveniently overlooked The rest of our visit to West Cork was a delight as we enjoyed this place apart with its small hidden bays and beaches good food and hospitality and an adventure around almost every twisting corner One of the important offshoots of the pandemic is that most of us have been spending our holidays at home and visiting places which we might not have seen before now One morning my wife and I set off for Murlough in north Antrim and we ended up at Torr Head not far from Fair Head I had never been to Torr Head but it was worth the visit despite the difficult drive on narrow roads At one stage I drove round a corner only to be confronted by what looked like a strange version of Rathlin Island In fact it was the Mull of Kintyre in Scotland and on that sunny day I felt that I could almost touch it This year I have seen cars from Waterford Kerry Donegal and Dublin in the north and also many northern cars in the Republic This is a welcome development at a time where there is worrying political speculation about a possible border poll Do people realise that in a united Ireland some Irish Government money could end up in Armagh or Tyrone and also that people in the north would not be nearly so well off financially without our NHS and other extensive Westminster funding In other words be careful what you wish for In the meantime we should all continue to travel across the border in both directions and get to know each other better As human beings we have more in common than we might think and we need to work together towards a better future for all of us We need to work together towards a brighter future

430,../data/sec_IRL/Belfast Telegraph/Factiva-20230807-170, People called me a SF Trojan horse but there was nothing from paramilitaries Gail Walker Wörter Oktober   National   Independent  Media Northern Ireland Diane Dawson the school principal at the centre of an Irish language row talks to Gail Walker about unionism faith and going to buy perfume after her flat was damaged by a bomb THE day Diane Dawson was offered her first teaching job she returned home to find her rented Belfast flat wrecked by a bomb at a nearby RUC station Briefly she considered tidying up but instead opted to jump on a bus into the city centre to treat herself to a bottle of perfume shed never been able to afford before Thirty years on the highprofile principal of Braniel Primary School in the east of the city relates the incident to emphasise two points how much she wanted to be a teacher but also the huge transformation peace has brought to Northern Ireland Inadvertently though the anecdote also reveals flashes of the determined steely and vivacious character thats propelled her from a tough Protestant upbringing in rural south Armagh one of nine siblings in a cramped council house to among the most inspiring and strongest voices in education today When I was told there was a post for me at Carrs Glen primary in north Belfast I ran home really excited recalls Dawson I lived in a secondfloor flat on the Lisburn Road and earlier that day thered been a bomb in the police station opposite it My bedroom window was blown in the place was covered in glass I just looked around this room completely decimated and thought Ill fix this later but Im away to get a wee bottle of Clinique Id smelt it on other people but never been able to afford it so I raced into town and bought this travelsized bottle Its strange to think that a short time earlier when Id arrived at Queens Id been terrified of being in the city because of the violence but in four years Id developed a resilience I think that shows the strength in adversity that we get in Northern Ireland Dawson has certainly honed a sense of fearlessness during numerous challenges over the intervening years Over the summer when Braniel PS which sits in the heart of loyalist east Belfast was engulfed in a row over the proposed location of an Irish language nursery on its site she declared with typical alacrity her support for it I am a unionist I will be first foremost and last a unionist and not one word of the Irish language spoken undermines or weakens my unionism she says The nursery chose a new location but the fact Dawson had the overwhelming support of parents speaks volumes for the esteem in which she is held The social media campaign against it was instigated by a couple of people I was branded a Sinn Fein Trojan horse for the Irish language but there was no concern about the Naiscoil from community representatives or paramilitaries she says Currently shes an outspoken advocate for better safety measures in schools as wreaks havoc She wants the definition of a close contact redefined and reinstatement of the eightday isolation period Dawson herself is CEV clinically extremely vulnerable due to a chronic chest disease and isolated for six months earlier in the pandemic though this disclosure only inadvertently slips out an hour into her blistering takedown of the authorities Thats by the by she says pausing briefly Dont make it about me Its about my little people my staff and their families But it is worth focusing on Dawsons story a riveting tale of defying the odds to succeed thanks to parental support good teachers and of course the sheer force of that personality There are regrets too With biting irony shes surrounded by children at work but has none of her own by choice That decision was influenced by her Christian faith and shes made peace with it now but the midlife reflections that come later in our conversation are wise and considered Dawson grew up in Collone a townland halfway between Markethill and Armagh city during the Troubles It was quite an experience she says I maybe wasnt the evolved person I am now She lived in blissful ignorance of sectarianism until the age of I only found out there were Catholics and Protestants because my best friend who was Catholic and one year older started at St Catherines in Armagh She explained the difference then It was very difficult when I was around to years old Friends fathers were in the UDR My closest friends dad was shot though thankfully survived You just dont have the luxury of sitting on the fence when youre living in that kind of environment I wouldnt say it was a hardline unionist or loyalist background but you started to realise what was happening She was nervous about attending Queens University A trip to Belfast a year earlier with her brother for a dental appointment proved a harbinger We were on the motorway and saw people running in Milltown Cemetery this hysteria I remember saying I never want to live in Belfast Later we found out it was the Michael Stone attack When Dawson began her joint honours degree in English language and literature she soon discovered sectarianism was rife on campus It was Whats your name What school did you go to All to find out if you were Catholic or Protestant Young people were indoctrinated into that mindset then The woman who proudly tells me that Braniel is the warmest most inclusive community we have children who are Protestant Catholic Muslim who have done their First Confession and First Communion evidently always had an instinctive desire to break down cultural barriers Upon graduating she took a year out with Voluntary Service Belfast working at St Pauls School for Travellers off the Falls Road and a nurseryafterschool club in loyalist Sandy Row I did mornings at St Pauls and afternoons in Sandy Row I feared for my life manys a time travelling from one to the other but I loved both At St Pauls the children would say Teacher let Diane read the story because Id put on all these accents After a PGCE at Stranmillis she began teaching at Carrs Glen PS where she became literacy coordinator then reading recovery teacher and later viceprincipal Thirteen years ago she was appointed head at Braniel which has pupils and staff Though Dawson loves the job now theyll carry me out of here in a box initially it was very difficult I was fighting fires from within the community from parents legacy issues within the school Two senior SEELB people visited and said theyd never had a principal face such challenges in years For two and a half years Id get to the roundabout at Gilnahirk on the way home every day and ask Why God Why am I experiencing this But we were never told that we wouldnt be tested or that life wouldnt be difficult My Mum had a saying about how God made the back to fit the burden so Id resolve to carry on The subject frequently returns to that of Dawsons parents Her father originally from Monaghan was a farm labourer before working in construction After sitting exams he became a semiskilled engineer He was bright she declares proudly Her mother worked as a cleaner and knit Aran jumpers which went as far as America and Canada to bring in extra money Dawson accompanied her mum on a monthly visit to Lennoxes shop in Armagh to buy wool Id be looking at the books She knew I loved reading and would tell me You can have for a book or for sweets but not both Id always choose the book but on the way home shed stop at another shop and buy me sweets too I never forgot that Dawson and I discover that we both still have The Great Writers classic novels collection a handsome leatherbound partwork merchandised during the late Eighties Each one cost £ a sizeable sum to be prised from a parent We were a family of in a threebedroom house I saw how difficult it was for them to make ends meet Thats why my heart is for my family and also for my school if a pupil hasnt a lunch Ive gone out and bought one She had similar support at Markethill High where her potential was quickly spotted Laughing Dawson recalls a firstyear English class The teacher read out the first line from Pride and Prejudice about how A man in possession of a large fortune is in want of a good wife then asked What do you think I put up my hand and said Thats true Sir he needs someone to help him spend it and he roared with laughter He inspired me so much When I left at to go to tech he gave me some of his old books from university A few years ago Dawson sought him out wanting to thank him for that early support and was deeply vexed to learn he had passed away The worst type of teacher which she also experienced is the one who makes you so frightened you stop learning Dawsons Presbyterian parents were not churchgoers but made their children recite the Catechism on Saturday nights after bathtime Mission halls dot the Armagh countryside and it was inside one of those small wooden buildings where she had something of a religious epiphany Theyd put wee kids on buses and take them to meetings In Killeen Brethren aged I decided that Jesus was real and my faith was real Shortly afterwards republican gunmen shot dead three worshippers in nearby Darkley mission hall It was absolutely terrifying At meetings wed think This could be us someone could burst into a church or chapel at any time Her faith has been a mainstay but a journey too You hit and off you go but by I remember it was April I thought Its time to get my act together again She attended the Christian Fellowship Church for many years but doesnt belong to any denomination now Church for me now is people and community sharing my faith with them Shes never married so didnt have children I wouldnt want to offend anyone by saying this but my faith is that family should be within the confines of a marriage Nor would I want to offend any fellas Id some good relationships but I never wanted to get married At I told Mum Id never do so I felt very complete and I never wanted to settle for mediocre I dont regret not getting married but not having children is a regret One thing I will say though and this isnt a quip is that God has blessed me with thousands including wonderful nieces and nephews When I walk into the school playground the lines of pupils just erupt they come running to hug me Ive been very fortunate really It was terrifying At meetings you would be thinking that could be it someone could burst in at any time My bedroom window was blown in and the place was covered in glass but I thought to myself Id go and buy a bottle of Clinique

436,../data/sec_IRL/Belfast Telegraph/Factiva-20230807-170, Seeing Covid in apocalyptic terms some churches are alive with wild fears Sam McBride Wörter November   National   Independent  Media Northern Ireland While many Christians have risked their lives to fight the virus others are continuing to spread dangerous conspiracy theories IN January if Northern Ireland was an independent country its rollout of the coronavirus vaccine would have been the thirdfastest in the world In global terms Northern Ireland is still doing well official statistics say it is now approaching of adults with at least one dose But those statistics overstate the true number of vaccinations The Department of Health shows more people in several age categories have been vaccinated than they think exist That is not evidence of some conspiracy Its evidence that the government only has an estimate of the population and it has underestimated how many people live here But if the department thinks more than of people in older age groups have been vaccinated that means its overall percentage is overstated Even based on the headline figure Northern Ireland has been overtaken by many other countries which had a slower start We are now in last place among the four UK nations and the Republic of Ireland The reason is on one level simple fewer people here want to be vaccinated than in other parts of the British Isles But the more difficult question to answer is why that would be so Part of that answer lies in our evangelical Christian community a difficult to define group for whom personal salvation is central to their faith and who take the Bible as the ultimate spiritual authority This week I spoke to multiple people spanning the worlds of churches politics healthcare and government who have seen a unique form of Covid misinformation in a subset of evangelical Christianity Most of the individuals are themselves from that community which is much larger in Northern Ireland than elsewhere in these islands and do not want to deride it but want the issue to be better understood because lives are at stake One senior church figure said some of those believing the more lurid claims are very vulnerable people and often elderly Those involved in spreading misinformation about the vaccine represent a minority within a minority As with faith groups in general most evangelical churches have stuck rigidly to government advice throughout the pandemic and most continue to exceed the governments minimum requirements for large gatherings One evangelical leader highlighted that many evangelicals have been on the front line in hospitals and so are clear about the reality of the pandemic He also highlighted myriad examples of how churches practically helped the needy over the last yearandahalf However that is only part of the story On the fundamentalist wing of Christianity a very different narrative has emerged which infuses some of the secular conspiracy theories circulating online with theological additions The most lurid and powerful of those conspiracy theories is that the pandemic is being orchestrated by Satan that the vaccine is paving the way for the apocalyptic Mark of the Beast and that the end of the world is nigh One Free Presbyterian who is alarmed at how many of their friends in various churches have accepted this idea said the key to understanding their susceptibility to such ideas lies in eschatology the theological study of the end of history Those who believe the Book of Revelation predicts a coming antichrist with a global government and tight controls on the population will always be looking for hints of such events he said To such people the extraordinary measures taken to combat the virus are unsettling Another Free Presbyterian said some members of their church had left because it did not resist government advice to close churches and had gone to an independent church near Dungannon called The Lifeboat Fellowship Although that church building only holds people sermons preached there are streamed online and some have been watched by thousands The churchs pastor Bertie Johnston has repeatedly denounced some of the measures taken to curb the spread of the virus In a sermon three months ago he said The spirit of antichrist is amongst us in power elderly people died in two months in Bulgaria as a result of the vaccination and theres not one word about it Gesticulating with his arm he exclaimed You never hear those things He added Its time that we wakened up to see that we were right right from the beginning that behind this is the Devil In the rambling sermon which was titled Jab or Jail and included several inaccurate claims he said this is germ warfare and theyre threatening the mothers now that they cant get their children educated theyre offering vouchers to go to their nearest shop if they get vaccinated Thats intimidation thats blackmail God will look after your children God will keep us free from Covid In another sermon he objected to having to leave his name in a cafe for track and trace but said he had reluctantly complied He predicted that vaccine passports and credit cards will all be obsolete very soon will all give way to the chip and it will be He told his congregation to get ready for economic collapse and warned this is going to be the last stand I tell you The new world order is on its way The Devil is on his way The next thing is the Mark of the Beast This is all preparing us for the antichrist When contacted by the  Mr Johnston initially denied peaching against the vaccine I dont know where you heard that because I never once stated that If you have any evidence that I stated not to have the vaccine you produce it because I didnt Asked if he had any concerns about the vaccine he said Thats a personal view Asked then if it was something which he would preach he said No Mr Johnston became more hesitant when parts of his sermons were read to him saying he did not know where his claim about mass deaths in Bulgaria came from I could find no evidence for this and Bulgaria has one of Europes lowest vaccination rates that he couldnt remember some of what he had said and that Im only one elder in the church He went from denying he had ever urged people not to be vaccinated and saying he wears a mask when asked to do so to reiterating that the situation is linked to the Devil But then he said We have had people with Covid we appreciate that its real Eventually he said of his linking Covid to the Mark of the Beast I could explain that very simply but Im not going to do it over the phone At the time of going to press written questions to Mr Johnston remained unanswered However some evangelicals have been shaken by how Covid has impacted those they know DUP councillor Paul Hamill an ardent Covid sceptic died in September after weeks battling for life in hospital Before entering politics the had been the de facto minister of a Belfast City Mission hall in Rathcoole loosely linked to the Presbyterian Church Two of his friends said that after he entered intensive care many of his antivaccine friends got the jab Despairingly one traditionalist evangelical told how a member of their church had left because of being asked to wear a mask An evangelical minister said an antivaccine campaigner lambasted him for allowing his teenage children to be vaccinated Another evangelical leader estimated that only about of evangelicals are in the hardline camp of conspiracy theories Estimates of the evangelical community are imprecise but if that is correct it would only amount to a few thousand people at most However a central feature of conspiracy theories is that they do not only impact the individual but especially with social media are spread far beyond them For people who believe this is the end of the world their motivation will be intense Evangelicals have long been heavily influenced by ideas from America where white evangelicals are among those least likely to be vaccinated Unsurprising given how overwhelmingly evangelicals had backed Donald Trump who made light of the seriousness of Covid but ultimately was vaccinated Some Christians object to the use in some of the vaccines of cell lines originally derived from an aborted foetus in the That is one of the reasons why some ultraconservative Catholics have embraced antivaccine messages Dr Anne McCloskey and Bernie Smyth two outspoken Catholic opponents of abortion have circulated antivaccine material that has been criticised by medics Rev Trevor Gribben clerk of the Presbyterian General Assembly and secretary to the Church Leaders Group which brings most churches together said they had worked well with Stormont which had only legally forced the closure of churches for two weeks the rest of the time the churches had voluntarily moved to online services He contrasted that with the Irish Government which had not worked as closely with religious leaders David Smyth head of the Evangelical Alliance in Northern Ireland said his organisation had facilitated ethical discussions about vaccines in which experts discussed some Christian concerns and that across the UK evangelical churches have worked with the NHS to increase vaccine uptake among ethnic minorities Mr Smyth said Many evangelicals understand the extraordinary steps to protect public health but there is also a natural hesitancy with evangelicals about any perception of giving up freedoms and rights due to our history of dissent That hints at one means of reducing the potency of endtimes conspiracies There were commentators who last year simplistically demanded prolonged lockdown with no awareness of some of the unintended consequences especially for religious communities The instinctive suspicion of government which many evangelicals feel means that a government order to close churches could create problems at a later stage feeding a sense of persecution and ultimately undermining the longterm battle with Covid That need for greater understanding involves churches as well There is an antiintellectual streak within parts of evangelical Christianity which is suspicious of experts and learning despite the fact that historically Christianity prized education and Protestant reformers emphasised reason and critical thinking Greater historical understanding within evangelical churches would highlight how many of the measures taken during this pandemic social distancing meeting outside isolating the sick are modern versions of what many Protestant reformers endorsed as waves of plague swept across Europe hundreds of years ago In one of his sermons Pastor Johnston cited how Martin Luther had refused to flee Wittenburg when plague arrived in and lauded people like Luther as those who believed God would protect them But a deeper understanding of history would reveal how that fatalistic approach is not new and the logical contradiction in it was obvious to Luther himself years ago The German reformer lampooned a similar argument saying By such reasoning when a house is on fire no one should run outside or rush to help because such a fire is also a punishment from God He went on to say Others sin on the right hand They are much too rash and reckless tempting God and disregarding everything which might counteract death and the plague They disdain the use of medicines they do not avoid places and persons infected by the plague but lightheartedly make sport of it and wish to prove how independent they are God has created medicines and provided us with intelligence to guard and take good care of the body so that we can live in good health Truly there is no new thing under the sun The most lurid and powerful of the conspiracy theories is the pandemics orchestrated by Satan that the end the world is nigh The new world order is on its way I tell you this is all preparing us for the antichrist

Northern Ireland In conversation with PROFESSOR RUTH WHELAN Ruth Whelan is Professor of French at the National University of Ireland Maynooth Q Can you tell me a little about yourself AI have been Professor of French at the National University of Ireland Maynooth since before that a lecturer at Trinity College Dublin from I was educated in primary and secondary schools run by Holy Faith and Loreto nuns I studied for my BA in French and Spanish at TCD and for my doctorate at TCD and later in Paris awarded in and when did you come to faith AI was nurtured in faith from my earliest years it was the frame of reference in which our north Dublin Catholic family moved However my parents who grew up in Tullow Co Carlow never really left their rural narrow and somewhat superstitious Catholic beliefs behind As I grew in body mind and spirit their frame of reference progressively became a bad fit for me As a Trinity student I began reading scripture I also audited classes in New Testament Greek and after a couple of years of reading and reflection I left the Catholic Church for the Reformed tradition After a few more years of exploration that meant throwing in my lot with the Presbyterian Church and I am currently a member of Christ Church Sandymount But my spiritual home is the French Reformed Church where exegeticallybased biblical preaching and a broad spirit of openness go hand in hand contrary to what the PCI has become over my lifetime although it was not always so Q Have you ever had a crisis or a gnawing doubt about your faith A Being a person of faith is a form of ongoing crisis if I stop questioning then I will be dead The pandemic is my latest crisis I cant square all those dead people with the loving providence of God But like the psalmist I prefer to shout that out to the heavens rather than give up a spiritual sense of the world and the presenceabsence of God which is vital to my existence Q Have you ever been angry with God and if so why A There have been a number of times some lengthy illness hopelessness death of a beloved betrayal nearfatal accidents workplace bullying workplace misogyny whatever when I stomped on fists clenched by my side head bowed with effort until I came out the other side But sometimes I got through precisely because of a consciousness or a deliberately cultivated consciousness that the power of God was sustaining me Such are the complexities of faith in the challenges of life During one very difficult time I repeated as a mantra dunamis theou power of God somewhat obsessionally as a way of maintaining equilibrium when all seemed lost Q Do you ever get criticised for your faith AWhen I moved from the Catholic to the Reformed tradition I experienced sharp hostility rejection and constant even unremitting criticism from family and friends When I competed for the chair of French and was appointed at Maynooth I was met with barbed comments about Penal laws remarks such as all Protestants are foreigners from an academic staff member who should have known better sectarian comments about Presbyterians exclusion and even students who asked permission from their priest before following courses on Protestant authors I am a specialist of the Huguenots and their literature especially in exile from As the only woman professor at the time and one of few Protestants on campus I was something of a transitional figure contributing to a shift in mores Maynooth University is now multicultural and people of faith are rarer than hens teeth apart from St Patricks College with which we share our beautiful campus In the early days as a Reformed Christian when life was unbelievably tough my minister said simply to me one day Everyone has to plough their own furrow So thats what I do I just go on plowing my own furrow Q Are you ever ashamed of your own Church or denomination AThe PCIs decision in to exclude LGBT people from communion and their children from baptism is a source of shame and embarrassment to me The shoddy ideological abuse of scripture the superficial and poorly prepared preaching of many ministers with some notable exceptions is another source of shame Q What about people of other denominations and faiths A They are often beautiful and unwittingly perhaps can sometimes put Christians to shame Q Are the Churches fulfilling their mission A The echoing sound of all those footsteps walking away from the PCI in the last few years and from the Catholic Church over the last quartercentury is answer enough to that question Q Has religion helped or hindered the people of Northern Ireland AI am unable to answer that question but I cherish the memory of those from Northern Ireland who loved and supported me in my early life when the world seemed against me and who embodied for me what it means to belong to the mystical body of the Church Q What is your favourite film book and music A The films of Robert Guediguian are favorites To unwind I love detective fiction including Louise Penny Fred Varga and Ausma Zehanat Khan Bach and Mozart never grow old for me Joan Baez and Leonard Cohen continue to inspire I long to be back at a concert in the Philarmonie de Paris with its vast auditorium extraordinary acoustics and worldclass musicians Q Where do you feel closest to God A In mindful meditation on scripture floating cruciform rocked by the waves in a calm sea Q What inscription would you like on your gravestone A The darkness is not dark to thee Or as a lifelong public servant devoted to educating the young Well done good and faithful servant you have been faithful over a few things major regrets QAny A As a former abbot of Glenstal Abbey once said during a radio interview and I never forgot you live the life that you can So lets all channel

445,../data/sec_IRL/Belfast Telegraph/Factiva-20230807-170, Teasers God is not an equal a pal We cant know His mind Great is the mystery of faith Alf McCreary Wörter Dezember   National   Independent  Media Northern Ireland In conversation with REV CANON HELENE STEED Rev Canon Helene Steed is rector of St Marks Church of Ireland Dundela Q Can you tell us something about yourself AI am I was born in Gothenburg Sweden and grew up in Boras where I was educated I am married to Christopher an English research scholar who specialises in African history We have two children William who died when he was nine weeks old and Grace who is In I graduated with a MDiv from Uppsala University and a year later I completed my pastoral training at theological college and was ordained in the diocese of Skara in the Church of Sweden and served for eight years in rural ministry In we moved to Cork city on my appointment as deans vicar of St Fin Barres Cathedral Church of Ireland Four years later I became rector of the Clones group of parishes in Co Monaghan During the last couple of years in the Diocese of Clogher I served as archdeacon We arrived in Belfast in and I am rector of St Marks a beautiful Butterfield church and CS Lewiss home parish Q How and when did you come to faith AI was brought up going to church during the main festivals and attended different childrens groups in the local parish church Significant for making the Christian faith my own was the year I was prepared for confirmation at which had a profound impact on me and my faith journey The confirmation course lasted for the best part of an academic year and apart from learning the catechism we had many wonderful spiritual experiences One that stands out is celebrating holy communion in a forest glade gathered around a campfire as the leaves were falling It was during that year that I became aware that God called me to the priesthood It started as niggling which was confirmed with my grandmother Hulda saying You will be like her pointing at our local young female vicar Ordained ministry is a way of life a bit like farming day and night every day of the year Faith is part of and influences every aspect of life And it is good Q Have you ever had a crisis or a gnawing doubt about your faith AI have never had a crisis and never considered giving up my faith But there have been times when I have struggled One such was when our son William died aged nine weeks Vividly I remember having a cup of coffee with my colleague and friend Michael who asked me How are you getting on with God and faith I replied Presently I am living off the interest from previous investments Faith previously nurtured kept me going Looking back our short time with our son enriched our lives tremendously and made me a better person That would not have happened without Christ gently leading me through Q Have you ever been angry with God and if so why A It is easy to blame God when life takes an unpredictable turn for the worse and feelings of anger appear But when calmly thinking I time after time discover it is not God that I am angry with rather it is with myself or unforeseen circumstances that are beyond me God is not an equal a pal We cannot know the mind of God Great is the mystery of faith you afraid of hellfire QAre AI am not afraid of fire as such but I recognise the reality of hell For me this is annihilation of the soul That is terrifying Q Do you believe in a resurrection and if so what will it be like AYes Good and warm with a welcoming Christ with outstretched arms In our Fathers house there are many mansions the furnishings and designs are an unknown surprise It will be totally new which we cannot imagine a different dimension Q Are the Churches here fulfilling their mission can always become better AWe Satisfaction without critical selfexamination leads to complacency I think my and other Churches need to be encouraged to connect increasingly with the wider community to love and serve We ought to be proud of what we believe and share it Q Why are so many turning their backs on organised religion AI am not convinced they are During the pandemic I think more people have discovered faith and connected with Churches both online as well as in person We just have to be imaginative and connect with them Q Has religion helped or hindered in Northern Ireland AI am not from Northern Ireland but I think religion has been hijacked and used in a simplistic and even ignorant manner to further other causes than faith It is hard to quantify to what extent but Churches and their organised groups and activities have kept people off the streets and prevented them from partaking in acts of violence Also I do not think we should underestimate the help support and consolation people who have suffered during Northern Irelands troubled past have found through faith and Churches of all denominations Q What is your favourite film book and music and why AI have many favourite books including Barchester Towers by Anthony Trollope or Jerusalem by Selma Lagerlov or Chimanda Ngozi Adichies novels including her powerful short book Notes on Grief The cantata Carmina Burana by Carl Orff is definitely a musical frontrunner as its intensity totally surrounds you One film that made an impression is Queen of the Desert portraying the strong and independent woman Gertrude Bell Q Where do you feel closest to God AI cannot pick just one Sitting quietly in a church gathering around the holy table receiving the body and blood of our Lord or sitting in the boat fishing on the fjord where I grew up all remind me about Gods awesome presence which often is materialised in a small voice of calm Q What inscription would you like on your gravestone A Our citizenship is in heaven the Swedish translation is far more poetic Vart hemland ar himmelen Our home is in heaven you any major regrets QHave ANo

the big trends of last year and Margaret Canning finds theres no regret about making a big move to Northern Ireland for two families B ELFAST has been named one of the UKs top five cities for residential investment as a trend for people to return home to the province after long periods away looks set to bed in during Commercial property agents Colliers puts Belfast at number five in the top UK cities for people to invest in residential property Edinburgh is the number one city followed by Cambridge London Manchester and Dublin But Belfast claims the top spot for liveability Colliers report says Northern Irelands reputation for good schools is a major pull But the pandemic practice of working from home is perhaps an even bigger trigger In Colliers words its been encouraging reallocations to the city from peer group UK cities a trend now very prevalent in the middle to upper house brand sector One family who moved here from Farnborough England last year Italianborn Rita Malosti her Co Mayo husband Ken Hennigan and daughter Amelia say theyve no regrets about their relocation Emma Grossmith an employment lawyer from Northern Ireland whos lived away for years said experiencing the pandemic while living in Sweden contributed to her decision to move back here at the end of last year Shes now living in Banbridge with her husband daughter whos and a son of Husband James continues to work as a musician in Sweden Emma says I left Northern Ireland to go to university at Cambridge and I always meant to come back Then I met my husband at university Hes a musician so musicians have to go where the work is I got a good job and was working in Scotland and London then he got a great job in Sweden so we went to Sweden But a lot of time went by and my homesickness never got better in fact it got worse It was awful and I think probably the pandemic had something to do with it We couldnt fly and we didnt know what would happen if we both got sick It was really quite dreadful It took a situation where I was one day hoping to go home into a situation where I really had to take major steps to make that happen She had become accustomed to working remotely for her UK employer after moving to Sweden in That was unusual back when we moved there in but of course that has changed now Emmas father is the former Church of Ireland Archbishop of Armagh Alan Harper Her par ents and two sisters still live in Northern Ireland and her brother lives in England We lived all over the place when I was a child Because my dad was in the church we were moving around quite a bit though most of my education was in Methody College in Belfast She says she feels happy with her decision to move home even though the practicalities were complex It was tremendously difficult with two children to get all the ducks in a row and to find somewhere to live Ive had tremendous support from my family who are all living locally and I havent at any point felt this is the wrong decision But I havent felt it was purely kind of a spur of the moment mistake no My heart is really at home and I feel really good about being back We were very isolated in Sweden We only had each other If the wheels had come off healthwise for he or I we would have been on our own I feel just a lot safer being at home She is thinking about her childrens future in Northern Ireland I hope Northern Ireland will give the children the opportunities that I had Having moved from Sweden where it is a very socialist egalitarian and liberal environment I was concerned would I find the place too oldfashioned and I do think NI has a long way to go But I also think it has moved on tremendously and the vast majority of people have moved on tremendously in their attitudes to each other Handled properly NIs unique position postBrexit could be great Her family are very pleased that shes home My sister Ann let us live in her house while we were trying to find a house here and that was really kind and a big ask We have now bought our home and have just moved so thats wonderful Weve bought in Banbridge which is where our family have been for generation upon generation so its really good to be back One of the things that was a bit of a surprise was just how much the NI housing market had gone up in I dont know what happened Things were going for well above the asking price and it was difficult to find the right house so thank goodness its done now She feels that the transformation brought about by the wider acceptance of homeworking will see others follow in her footsteps I do think hybrid working is going to be become the norm at least for those who can do it I think those who consider themselves Northern Irish but feel trapped by their work will be thinking Why cant I take my work with me I can do it wherever I am Rita Malosti and her family moved here over the summer Her husband Kenneth is a musician and in his day job works from home for an aerospace corporation Rita is head of space activities at Skytek an Irish software firm which last year started an operation here Shes full of enthusiasm about her new home We simply love living in Belfast The first few weeks had been extremely stressful due to the fact that the house sale in England fell through at the last minute literally the day we had the movers in the house collecting all of our stuff So we had a few hurdles to overcome to move into our new house here The flexibility and willingness to help we found in people here were amazing We totally did not expect that We felt like people understood we had a big problem and despite the fact that it was not their problem they did their best to help us This applied to everyone we met during that period the family that was hosting us in the first few weeks in their Airbnb the solicitor that took care of the purchase of our house here the developer that was selling us the house It made us feel truly welcome and we even started some lovely friendships Once Amelia got settled at school the family started enjoying our new city I suppose in England we lived a different life too far from London to be a city life and not isolated enough to live a country life So we had the worst of both worlds really plus the added stress of the commute without the practical pros of a city After having lived in Rome for years before moving to England both Ken and I were looking forward to being closer to a city but we didnt know what to expect from Belfast We soon realised that Belfast is a gem It is big enough to feel like a city but small enough to go around quickly and for our not to get overwhelmed or lost in it She loves the proximity to the North Coast where the family has been spending a lot of time Co Mayo where Ken is from is only three hours drive from here and weve had the chance to go and visit his family much more easily than we would have had before especially with Covid We have been here only a few months but we all feel very integrated already from the wonderful neighbours to the community we share our fitness passion with at the gym Amelia found many great friends straight away in school and through the extracurricular activities she is enjoying We are very happy with our choice and look forward to spending many more years here in Belfast David Menary head of residential at Colliers said both families are typical of a wider trend Colliers transacted a higher number of homes in Cultra North Down and Greater Belfast on and off the open market last year mainly to buyers returning from London the UK and further afield Many professionals can now work from home and have made the life changing decision to sell up their homes and come back to NI to work remotely maintaining their higher salaries resulting in purchasing high value low density housing and having a better quality of living for them and availing of the firstclass schooling We are very happy and look forward to spending many more years here Its been difficult with two children to get all the ducks in a row

457,../data/sec_IRL/Belfast Telegraph/Factiva-20230807-170, The Ukraine nightmare is only made worse by a nuclear threat we thought was all in the past Gail Walker Wörter März   National   Independent  Media Northern Ireland RECENTLY a few friends and I were recalling how as teenagers back in the Eighties we were terrified of imminent nuclear holocaust Wed laughed at our younger selves as we plundered the cultural memory bank to name all those old pop songs books and TV dramas depicting Armageddon But that stomachchurning dread from long ago has returned with a vengeance We find ourselves watching an horrific global crisis centred in Ukraine and suddenly talk of nuclear weapons is back on the daily agenda A reporter shouted a question to President Biden ahead of his State of the Union address on Tuesday Should Americans be afraid of a nuclear war Mr President The very question would have been unimaginable a fortnight ago And Mr Bidens reply No was hardly the resounding denial many would have hoped Our collective nerve has been shredded by living in the permacrisis Were ground down by two years of pandemic This week another report heralds climate catastrophe Before that Brexit Instability uncertainty and chaos is our new normal Above all I want peace to be brokered and the war to stop for those men women and children suffering so terribly in Ukraine But I also want a cessation because of a profound dread of what an escalation might bring Of course I know nuclear war is highly unlikely but its hard holding on to reason when Russia attacks a Ukrainian nuclear power plant and headlines scream that Putin is a mad man whose family is holed up in an underground city that can withstand nuclear attack and all humanity is at risk A deep terror hotwired into the psyche years ago instantly reignites A stark irony was lost upon us While terrorists wrought carnage in the Troubles what we feared most wasnt being obliterated by car bomb but nuclear annihilation But it is true that the immediacy of violence here gave an added sense of destruction and bereavement which neighbouring countries didnt have That fear still permeates the subconscious of many because we grew up immersed in images of atomic disaster all reflecting our powerlessness at the futility of it all often admittedly to the tune of incongruously upbeat music Nik Kershaws I Wont Let The Sun Go Down On Me Nenas Red Balloons Frankie Goes to Hollywoods Two Tribes and Queens Hammer to Fall were among many bouncy tracks foretelling doom For me nothing portrayed postDystopian tragedy like Kate Bushs Breathing about a baby born into nuclear devastation chips of plutonium Are twinkling in every lung Plutonium Geiger counters fallout shelters radiation sickness we gleaned all the jargon from the songs books and films we consumed with morbid fascination If Nolan Lives little graphic showing the impact of a nuclear bomb on Belfast City Hall outraged some as scaremongering then they should give thanks they never sat down on a school night to watch the nightmarish BBC drama Threads about a similar strike on a typical British city Z for Zachariah based on Robert C OBriens bestseller held out the grim prospect that even if you survived in a valley untouched by radiation someone would arrive to attack you When the Wind Blows an animation Testament they never had a chance to see their children grow up and The Day After were haunting It all felt so real Reagan Gorbachev the Cold War Greenham Commons womens camp Chernobyl in brought home literally how high the stakes were The weekend following the disaster it rained ceaselessly and my mother with an instinctive prescient caution insisted we stay indoors Radiation did spread of course Restrictions on sheep movements in Northern Ireland continued until We inked MAD on our canvas Army Surplus store schoolbags Why fret about homework when facing Mutually Assured Destruction We researched the whereabouts of the nearest nuclear shelter Undeniably many of my generation still feel compelled to feed the terror reading Russell Hobans recent masterpiece Riddley Walker set in Iron Age England years after a nuclear war and Cormac McCarthys The Road about a father and son walking across postapocalyptic America For Protestants there was and remains to a lesser extent a style of preaching fixated on the end of the world Historian Phillip Orr writes in his memoir The Illustrated History of Flight how his Baptist minister father ordered apocalyptic sermons from the US Such preaching didnt feature strongly in my Church of Ireland parish but it wasnt unusual to hear word of some fresh theological cause for concern from a fellow pupil or a street preacher Yet this fear of nuclear war is a crosscommunity paranoia recruiting frightened souls from all backgrounds all faiths and none This week I texted a friend from the other side of the house to ask if shed recovered from an illness but she was feeling worse than ever Terrified of being nuked was the swift response She meant it It feels wretchedly selfish to give into imagination and fear when we see vast horror unfolding in Ukraine Decent folk here protest at rallies and buildings are lit up in solidarity but then again just like the Eighties were still powerless as our leaders engage in the moral equivalent of a game of Twister Death and destruction are the same whether by knife handgun improvised devices barrackbusters pipe bombs or nuclear bombs It all needs to stop Ultimately thats what most people around the globe want The lyrics of Stings hit Russians were on the whole rounded but one line pondered I hope the Russians love their children too How offensive that was and is Could they possibly not Back then no one guessed that Gorbachev would set about dismantling the old Soviet empire But its still a fair bet that there wont be a nuclear war just because the Russians do surprise surprise love their children too

Presbyterian Church asking us to measure how far we have traveled as a city The tunes will be supplied by Arborist one of the most literate and affecting acts in the north The Cathedral Quarter Arts Festival is programming the night while the cause has been brought forward by Experience Belfast a project that tells the inspiring stories that we sometimes forget So the concert will ask us to remember Thomas McCabe a Lurgan man who worked in Belfast and attended the First Presbyterian on Rosemary Street He was friends with the Mc Cracken family and other century radicals and he worked hard to prevent the city from hosting a slavery company Ahead of the music there will be a summary of McCabes life from historian Raymond ORegan plus a dramatic enactment written by Cillian Lenaghan The questioning tone will then pass onto Mark McCambridge who has new material plus his familiar songs about soul belonging and how we might be better citizens Mark from Ballymena also records sea shanties under the guise of M Cambridge But his main distinction is two albums of lyrical finesse as Arborist He admits a debt to Seamus Heaney particularly his interest in evocative place names and how we relate to the land Mark also writes pithy strange storylines like Raymond Carver A wonderful track called Here Comes The Devil was rated Best Single in the Northern Ireland Music Awards He was fortunate in that the second Arborist album A Northern View was released and toured before the pandemic Since then he has been writing and planning He was approached about the First Presbyterian church event by Arthur Magee who runs the alternative tours of the city with Experience Belfast Mark was clearly impressed by the stories of Thomas McCabe and how he safeguarded the town from an appalling trade I think Im right in saying that Belfast was the only UK port city that did not accept slave ships Mark says Its an incredible thing to be involved with and obviously a brilliant cause He has recently come back from Richmond Virginia where the third Arborist album was recorded in an intense spree Mark had been dreaming of the classic American studios with a house band places like Motown in Detroit and Muscle Shoals Alabama He found his equivalent at Spacebomb It was an expensive trip but Mark had been recognised by the PPL Momentum Music Fund in Only nine acts including Yard Act had been selected across the UK The support gave Mark the approval he needed while some extra encouragement from the Arts Council of Northern Ireland was a convincing boost The price was beyond me he admits But lo and behold I had the good fortune of getting that funding which supplied the vast majority of what was required It certainly got me over the line to make it happen The Spacebomb visit hosted by studio boss and artist Matthew E White was hugely productive Even the unfinished mixes of the songs have a magnificent flow and a latenight quality thats been enhanced by the strings the brass and the woodwind Fittingly theres a fresh track called Dreaming in Another Language On the final day at the studio he got to hear the project taking shape The arranger Trey Pollard came in with the scores and the extra players The euphoria of the moment has not left Mark yet Because youre working so fast you dont get to hear much Youre making decisions fairly quickly as you go I hadnt heard much of what wed done back So that was the day when I got to sit back in the control room An element of selfdoubt creeps in but I was delighted with how things were sounding and what we had done And then you get the luxury of having these supreme arrangements played by supreme musicians over the top of it A orchestra It was pretty surreal but incredibly fulfilling It made it all worthwhile Now Mark is swapping notes with his musician friends at home getting prepared for the First Presbyterian gig His drummer and fellow Antrim pal Ben McAuley is now an Oscarnominated figure having worked on the production of Van Morrisons Belfast soundtrack The other Arborist players are less decorated but equally skilled at enhancing Marks tunes Come on down James Heaney Jonny Ashe and Richard Hill Theyre just incredibly keen to get playing again really You can sense a palpable energy to get back out there I have a lot of love for those guys and all the stuff weve done down the years You could be tempted to come back and completely reinvent things but I wanted to come back and be in a room and play music with them again and see where it goes Thats a big part of playing live To give these a runout The Cathedral Quarter Arts Festival in Belfast runs from April until May For more information about the programme see Arborist will play the First Presbyterian Church on April You can sense a palpable energy to get back out there

killer of Sir David Amess researched a host of politicians since his trial heard THE terrorist who murdered Sir David Amess described the fatheroffive as one off the list and believed that hundreds of MPs who voted for airstrikes against Isis deserved to die Ali Harbi Ali now had been plotting an attack since May and researched potential targets including Michael Gove Conservative MP Mike Freer defence secretary Ben Wallace deputy prime minister Dominic Raab Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer and Claudia Webbe His trial at the Old Bailey heard that he had walked around outside the Houses of Parliament on at least seven occasions sometimes carrying the knife he would use to murder Sir David in his bag Asked whether he would have tried to kill an MP if the opportunity had arisen before the attack on October Ali replied Yes definitely not just any MP the ones who voted in those motions to carry out attacks on Muslims in and He was referring to votes to carry out airstrikes on Isis territory in Iraq and Syria which he had researched on the They Work For You website to find MPs records While giving evidence at his trial Ali said that he considered Sir David and all other MPs who had voted for the military action enemies who deserved to die He wont be able to vote again so hopefully he will not be able to harm Muslims in that regard its one off the list he added The murderer said he wanted to send a message to colleagues who have done similar things something like that will always have a response Ali said that he had made excuses for not launching a terror attack earlier and that had been a writeoff year because the coronavirus pandemic had reduced opportunities Ill be honest with you theres been a lot of times where Ive gone out in my head with the plan to do something and then I would come back home he told police I bottled it yknow Maybe with the Sir David case in this case the plan was much more thought out than any of the other ones While being interviewed following the killing Ali claimed he had selfradicalised in or after becoming increasingly absorbed by news of Isis and the Syrian civil war He did not take up an offer to study medicine and later dropped out of a radiotherapy degree while planning to travel to Isis territories But Ali said that the security response made it more and more difficult to leave and Isis was losing territory so by he decided to do something domestic instead The terrorist described how he researched previous attacks as sort of examples such as in London Bridge Manchester and across Europe An MP was in my mind as sort of accessible numerous he told police I was sort of looking at carrying out an attack on an MP and it was sort of yknow try and find the correct MP He described how he started researching home addresses and political surgeries where he could attack having decided against striking MPs leaving the Houses of Parliament after seeing it was guarded by police officers who were armed to the teeth Records from his mobile phones and laptop showed numerous searches for different politicians and visits to their Wikipedia pages and voting records Asked by police how many potential targets he looked at he replied Quite a few I mean I wouldnt be able to remember everyone In May Ali saved a document entitled plans on his phone that detailed options for targeting Mr Gove at different times of day including while he was jogging or by causing a scene outside to lure him out of his home He changed plans after reading that the minister had broken up with his wife and moved house saying Mr Gove was no longer a viable option In September he lurked outside the constituency surgery of Conservative Finchley and Golders Green MP Mike Freer Ali was carrying the knife bought in Argos he would later use to murder Sir David but did not go inside He later did another search for MP surgeries on Twitter and saw a post about his eventual target in LeighonSea It was definitely a thing where maybe it was just he was the easiest he told police I settled on him He claimed he did not target Sir David because he was Christian or a Conservative and that if he was a Muslim who took the same votes in parliament it would have been the same thing Ali said he did not want to confuse the attack by killing other nonMuslims who were inside the Belfairs Methodist Church for the surgery adding I wanted it to be at the MP In police interview he spoke calmly about his terror plot and admitted allegiance to socalled Islamic State He told officers Sir David immediately suspected a sting having been duped into talking about a fake drug cake in the television series Brass Eye He went on I felt like one minute I was sat down at the table talking to him and the next he was sort of dead But yeah its probably one of the strangest days of my life now yknow Jurors were told Ali had no mental health issues and he accepted much of the evidence against him Sir David was killed five years after Batley and Spen MP Jo Cox was murdered in her constituency Her widower Brendan Cox said Ali will rot in jail and die in ignominy I was sort of looking at an attack on an MP

467,../data/sec_IRL/Belfast Telegraph/Factiva-20230807-170, On again off again the bizarre world of Trump and Morgan Andrew Buncombe Wörter April   National   Independent  Media Northern Ireland War of the egos As the pugnacious former president and the motormouth TV presenter cross swords again Andrew Buncombe smells a rat WHEN did it begin this strange thing this peculiar relationship between Donald Trump and Piers Morgan Was it once a friendship between a man and a boy or a boy and a manchild There was a true affection it appeared as Trump played the role of hardknuckled tycoon in The Apprentice and Morgan appeared as a convincingly fawning acolyte in a special episode featuring socalled celebrities Then there was more playacting on Air Force One Trump this time imitating a US president and Morgan pretending to be a journalist with tough questions Then they fell out it appeared Morgan who had once been Trumps loudest booster on social media and defended their friendship criticised his inaction as the coronavirus pandemic surged and the president appeared hapless and in denial He has to put the country before himself Morgan said in April Trump replied in a manner he perhaps correctly assessed would hurt Morgan most unfollowing him on Twitter And now there is more drama Last week Morgan released an edited clip of an interview with Trump that appeared to suggest the former president stormed off the set after being asked about his false claims of rampant voter fraud in the election Turn the camera off Trump snarls Very dishonest Trump responded to the outburst by saying Morgan had misled the public that he had not stormed off and released audio that appeared to show them talking amicably about golf after the exchange That was a great interview Morgan says Trump replies Yeah Piers Morgan like the rest of the fake news media attempted to unlawfully and deceptively edit his long and tedious interview Trump said in a statement on Thursday Morgan then claimed Trump was almost foaming at the mouth Asked to respond to Trumps dismissal of his claims Morgan said on Twitter His claim is fake news Donald Trump is and Piers Morgan is To their detractors it can appear both are about Yet for the past decade or so the pair of provocateurs and attentionseekers have fed off each other each appearing to boost the others ego The pair first met in or so Morgan had previously been sacked as editor of the Daily Mirror after the paper published hoax photographs claiming to show British soldiers mistreating Iraqi detainees The Mirror was also accused of being one of those Fleet Street tabloids that hacked the phones of celebrities to obtain personal information Morgan denied any wrongdoing He appeared for two seasons as a judge on Americas Got Talent and would sit alongside David Hasselhoff known for his role as lifeguard Mitch Buchannon on Baywatch and Brandy Norwood a singer and actor In he appeared as a contestant on and won a celebrity season of the The Apprentice which Trump had started in and would be both hugely successful but also crucial to his subsequent entry into politics It is instructive now to take a look at some of those scenes with Morgan alongside the likes of Gene Simmons and Stephen Baldwin trying with noticeable effort to advance to the final stages Some of the contestants do not appear to care very much but Morgan seems to really want to win You did an amazing job Trump tells him Not everyone was convinced A review on the website of NBCs Today Show questioned whether Morgan actually met the definition of celebrity For some contestants The Celebrity Apprentice was just another way to extend their fleeting moments of fame it said But on live TV in front of a studio audience Donald Trump might have done reality shows a disservice When he named Piers Morgan the winner Trump did little to change the notion that the genre is for the slightly betterthanmediocre stars at best Over the years the pair appeared to keep their association going each to the benefit of the other As a pugnacious host on the ITVs Good Morning Britain Morgan would defend his friendship with Trump even as the US president embarked on a series of controversial endeavours including a travel ban that targeted eight mostly Muslimmajority nations I have friends and family members who I totally disagree with about politics It doesnt mean I cant be friendly with them or like them Morgan said shortly after Trump took office in January Trump repaid Morgan in turn with a series of interviews BREAKING NEWS Morgan tweeted in July adopting the presidents cappedup style I just finished a interview with President Donald Trump aboard Air Force One Its his only UK TV interview will air on ITV exclusively on ITV The interview coincided with Trumps state visit to Britain The next day Morgan tweeted again WORLD EXCLUSIVE Inside Air Force One My interview with President Trump on the planets most elite plane His piece in the Daily Mail started Im sorry Mr Morgan but you cant sit in that chair Only the President of the United States of America ever sits in that chair I was in the Situation Room of Air Force One the airplane used to fly the most powerful human being on earth around the world Richard Painter who served as George W Bushs ethics lawyer and who has been a longtime observer of both men tells The Independent that both thrive on publicity and getting attention Donald Trump is somebody who made a name for himself on TV on The Apprentice Hes a TV person Hes addicted to TV watching Fox  Everything for him is about television says Painter who is currently campaigning as a Democrat for a seat in Congress Piers Morgans the same so they share that in common Theyre showmen Trump made his political career through the publicity of TV and being outrageous saying things that werent true but being outrageous so he can viewers get attention That was always his theme It was an attentiongetter And of course thats whats going on here Painter is not the only person to have suggested the apparent kerfuffle is little more than manufactured drama One point is certainly worth making The interview of Trump by Morgan was to be broadcast last night on Rupert Murdochs new TalkTV channel which is part of the Australians  UK In the US it will stream on Murdochs Fox Nation Indeed Trump will be the first guest for Morgan who famously stormed off the set of Good Morning Britain after being challenged over his constant criticism of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry whose show is titled Piers Morgan Uncensored The new show fronted by the former Good Morning Britain and CNN anchor will be a fearless forum for lively intelligent debate and agendasetting interviews celebrating free speech and the right for people to share their views the producers said ahead of the first episode This is the first show of its kind broadcast across three separate continents  London Independent Trump will be the first guest for Morgan Some of the contestants on The Apprentice did not appear to care very much but Morgan really seemed to want to win 
469,../data/sec_IRL/Belfast Telegraph/Factiva-20230807-170, I have been given the opportunity to appreciate and acknowledge the beauty in our differences Alf McCreary Wörter Mai   National   Independent  Media Northern Ireland THOUGHT FOR THE WEEKEND REV LYNNE GIBSON St Marks Ballymacash Lisburn I have spent the past week thinking and talking and even preaching about love Not the mushy sentimental kind or the shallow love which is as a noisy gong or clanging cymbal as St Paul writes in his letter to the Corinthians As Jesus prepared to leave his disciples he told them I give you a new commandment that you love one another as I have loved you To love as Jesus loved is not the softcentred love for a partner or even the deep bonds of love which we have with our families bonds which keep us close even when we are far apart Love for family and friends is the easy part Love as I have loved you is a greater challenge Love your neighbour strangers and enemies Love those who hurt and persecute you Love those who dont deserve your love those whom you cannot like Love the other Loving the other is much harder than judging them condemning them and avoiding them Time and again Jesus spoke soft words of love and compassion of understanding and forgiveness a rich young ruler Zacchaeus the woman caught in adultery He saw them and loved them In a fractured world where postpandemic healing comes slowly to love as Jesus did may seem like a huge demand We may think that we struggle to see and to show love and yet everywhere we hear the language of love and see the face of love I have seen love as a family sat with a loved one as he left this world for the next and then as they gathered to remember him in with sorrow and laughter Love which binds families together in their shared grief I have heard it in the coded language of love Text me when you get home safely I have watched in awe as a friend just weeks into a new job travelled to a Polish refugee camp to accompany Ukrainian families to England Love in action Loving as God loves In God we have the perfect model of how to love and lest we forget we have his reminder that we are to love our neighbour as ourselves In a world where we forget to love we can forget too that we are loved by the One who went to death and beyond to prove it We love because He first loved us In conversation with CHRISTINA BAILLIE Christina Baillie has been a youth officer in the Church of Ireland Connor Diocese since me about your background QTell AIm and married to Mark who works for Homeless Connect We live in Holywood and attend First Holywood Presbyterian Church After attending Larne and Grosvenor Grammar schools I studied social work at Queens University and I have worked in several social care contexts Q How and when did you come to faith A My parents modelled what it meant to live as a Christian and gave me the foundation for a strong faith I have a younger brother David and my dad is a Presbyterian minister I was blessed by having many church members encouraging me in my faith I made a firm commitment as a teenager at a Christian residential in Castlerock I was excited because it gave me a purpose and a hope Im thankful for youth leaders in churches and at residentials for the impact they had on my life your faith only for Sundays QIs A Faith permeates through all of my life However there are times when I dont join the dots and I do things for my own comfort or selfishness rather than letting my faith influence my actions As Im working for the church I get the privilege to spend more time thinking about how God is working in my life and the lives of the young people and leaders I connect with Faith spurs me on to live in a way which values others for who they are and seeks to encourage rather than tear down Q Have you ever been angry with God AI have definitely felt angry with God on occasions I have faced tough times and in those moments I couldnt understand why certain things were happening I longed for God to intervene In those angry moments I turned to Him and asked for His help Im quite an emotional person So I try to be as honest with God as I can I pray and speak to Him to share what Im experiencing but I also try to focus on Him to let that define how I respond Q Are you ever ashamed of your own church or denomination A Ashamed is too harsh a word but disappointed perhaps The church is for people who want to explore Gods goodness and take on the journey of becoming more like Jesus But we are so aware of the failings both individual and collective I think in those challenging moments I am aware that I too am not perfect Yet there is also a strange comfort in this When the church falls short it directs me again to God who is perfect and will bring renewal We are still people messing up and inevitably there will be hurt as a result I try not to dwell on the disappointment but ask God to continue to work in us so that we act in a way which honours Him and each other Q Are you afraid to die or can you look beyond death A When you read the promises in the Bible about a life free from pain and hurt time spent with a God who is creative and loving and in community with others who are at peace with one another its something that is an incredible gift Obviously the process of dying is not something I am looking forward to But I remember my grandmother and other people who have lived out their last days with dignity and held tightly to their faith This gives me confidence that God will sustain me through whatever comes you believe in a resurrection QDo AYes I believe in a renewed physical body mind and spirit The promise of healing from all pain hurt and loss feels like an incredible hope Q What do you think about people of other denominations and other faiths A Working and worshipping in different denominations has given me the opportunity to appreciate and acknowledge the beauty in our differences Being relatively new to the Church of Ireland I have been inspired by how liturgy in the service invites everyone to speak out truth week by week There is such a diversity in how we worship and serve the same God as Christians even in Northern Ireland never mind across the world Its always a challenge to learn from others and be open to difference but I always am blessed by engaging with others Q Are the churches here fulfilling their mission A There are so many who are striving to follow and love God Church leaders and members in various denominations are earnestly seeking to see new people discover Gods goodness and to equip all of Gods people to follow Him Many churches are leading the way in demonstrating compassion and practically helping people in the community As the costofliving crisis worsens the Church can continue to bless and uphold the vulnerable in our society Q Why are so many people turning their backs on organised religion is complicated and there AThis are a range of reasons why young people struggle to connect with established churches Many are searching for authentic community which reflects what they discover in the Bible and resonates with their lives Yet sadly the reality they experience can be different However many do find a godly and faithful community who care for them and point them to Jesus Q Some personal preferences what is your favourite film book music A Books Agatha Christie and local writers such as Steve Cavanagh and Stuart Neville Music Mumford Sons I have seen them live several times Film Knives Out in the murder mystery theme Q Where do you feel closest to God AWhen Im worshipping singing songs filled with truth about God and His promises Or during a youth festival or around my house or on a Sunday morning as part of a congregation Ive always enjoyed music and singing despite not being very gifted but I am more able to forget myself in those moments major regrets QAny A Thankfully thus far no major ones There may be things I would edit but Im grateful for all I have been given I have watched in awe as a friend travelled to a refugee camp to bring Ukrainian families to England

the Ulster Orchestra prepares to conclude its season Alf McCreary learns that theres still plenty to plan WHEN the Ulster Orchestra players end their final season concert in the Ulster Hall tonight under dynamic young chief conductor Daniele Rustioni they will not be packing suitcases for their holidays just yet Tomorrow they will be performing a show of club classics in the Botanic Gardens Next week they will take part in an international conductors workshop in Belfast for eight young musicians under the direction of the orchestras honorary principal guest conductor Jac van Steen from the Netherlands Recently their busy schedule included a concert at the prestigious Brucknerhaus concert hall in Linz Austria which was well received They have July off but return in early August for a packed schedule including a BBC Radio network concert on August This will be followed by three days of rehearsal before travelling to London for their August concert as part of the BBC Henry Wood Proms in the Royal Albert Hall They will also play the same programme in the Ulster Hall on August The London concert is a very big deal for the players and for Daniele who will be making his debut at the proms says Patrick McCarthy the orchestras head of artistic planning The concert will be broadcast live nationally and internationally on BBC Radio This will be a fantastic opportunity for the orchestra to demonstrate to a huge audience the high level of music performances which the players are presenting to local audiences here under the direction of Daniele He is an outstanding young conductor who is one of the rising global stars of classical music The Ulster Orchestra is in a good place musically and our aim is to build on that The orchestra like all other ensembles faced great challenges during the pandemic Patrick adds We developed a series streaming online which expanded our traditional audience For example we streamed performances on YouTube with wellknown artists such as singersongwriter Niamh Dunne and Dani Larkin the Irish traditional musician These were aimed at new audiences and they proved to be very successful With the help of a generous and significant grant from the Garfield Weston Foundation we have learned much more about digital broadcasting and now we have a couple of staff members specialising in that The orchestras season from was in two parts due to the pandemic The first was from September until December and we kept ourselves flexible in the hope that at some time things would begin to ease up which fortunately they did says Patrick The second part of the season was from January this year until now and this has gone well Some people have been a bit nervous about coming out due to Covid but the audiences have been returning gradually Last Friday we had an almost full house in the Ulster Hall where Barry Douglas was the soloist Overall however we have been finding like orchestras all over the world that our audiences are about of what they were before the pandemic and our challenge is to get those people back and to attract new listeners For example next May we will be staging a concert featuring the work of Neil Hannon of Divine Comedy fame We have commissioned a new work from him and we will also feature an existing composition titled To Our Fathers In Distress This was in honour of his father Bishop Brian Hannon who had been suffering from longterm Alzheimers disease and died in January The orchestras detailed programme for the next season will be announced publicly next week Another important development for the Ulster Orchestra is its historic move from its previous headquarters in Seymour House Gloucester Street at the heart of the city to the site of Townsend Street Presbyterian Church on the lower Shankill Road The main church has been closed because of a dwindling city centre congregation although worship still takes place regularly on the site The move is proving very beneficial because we have much more room than we had in the cramped premises in Seymour House says Patrick Our administration and other staff are now based in the Victorian schoolhouse beside the church and we are experimenting to find out if the acoustic in the old church will be suitable for our rehearsals Last week we rehearsed one of our concert symphonies in the church and this worked well If we can make the best use of the church premises in this way it will be a great advantage because in the recent past we have had to use several different venues for our rehearsals Patrick originally from Burton upon Trent was a freelance musician in his earlier days He played under distinguished international conductors including Sir Simon Rattle and the late Claudio Abbado and performed with worldfamous ensembles such as the Birmingham and London Symphony Orchestras as well as the BBC Symphony and Philharmonic Orchestras During this time he took part in Henry Wood BBC Prom concerts in the Royal Albert Hall In he joined the Ulster Orchestra as second trumpet but he left as a musician around the time of the orchestras survival crisis a few years later I had decided by that time that I had all the experience I wanted as an orchestra player and I took a masters in arts management at Queens University as I was moving in that direction In I joined the Ulster Orchestras administration staff and I was appointed as a senior manager two years later He lives in Muckamore with his wife Jacqueline who is from Derry and his children Roisin and Fintan Patrick believes that Northern Ireland is a wonderful place in which to live and in his current role he is confident that the Ulster Orchestra is moving in the right direction We want to give our audiences meaningful and unforgettable experiences in music and we must continue to discover how to do that for the widest possible range of people he says Different people want different things and our role as an orchestra is to continue to find out what we can be for them It is very exciting to be here in Townsend Street and it gives a very clear signal of what we think is our function for the people of Belfast and of Northern Ireland In more ways than one we really are now in a good place This was confirmed by Daniele Rustioni earlier this week when he spoke to me by phone from Munich Airport en route to Amsterdam and Belfast for rehearsals prior to tonights concert The Ulster Orchestra really is in great shape musically Daniele said Our concert in Linz was very well received and one music critic described it as sensational We are looking forward to the London Proms in August and it will give us a fabulous opportunity to showcase our individual and collective talents but we need to play there at the top of our form I missed one whole season because of the pandemic but I am staying on next season It is such a joy to be back with my orchestra These are happy days how could I not be happy 
471,../data/sec_IRL/Belfast Telegraph/Factiva-20230807-170, A life of service warmth and great reassurance long may it continue Gail Walker Wörter Juni   National   Independent  Media Northern Ireland How remarkable that a sheltered young woman who ascended the throne at the age of should have had such commitment such stamina such an exemplary reign over the last years writes Gail Walker NEAR the end of the fascinating and often elegiac BBC documentary Elizabeth The Unseen Queen the monarch reflects on how she must seem to us a rather remote figure someone whose face may be familiar in newspapers and films but who never really touches your personal lives Its a rather startling and moving moment of royal selfawareness and introspection from Her Majesty early in her reign a selfeffacing assessment brimming with pathos and poignancy For now as she marks her Platinum Jubilee the very opposite is true An enduring presence for the entirety of many of her subjects lives Elizabeth II is not a distant figurehead but acutely relevant Looked for on all major occasions Sought out at times of crisis such as her stirring address during the pandemic We will meet again she said her words sounding out from TVs in living rooms across the nation Iconic yet intimate By being a constant fixed reliable certain against momentous social change across seven decades the Queen holds a unique place in many hearts An amalgam of Corgis a Launer handbag and a headscarf lodged in the public imagination For some she is an adored monarch for others a kind of cultural cornerstone a relationship difficult to define beyond that it would seem utterly strange and unnerving if she were not there While the Queen herself remains enigmatic we rarely hear her speak could only hazard a guess at her opinions modern fame with its prying lenses tellall exclusives and internet gossip has systematically stripped away much of the mystique of monarchy Yet ironically that has not been all bad news for the Windsors If the scandals fallingsout divorces disappointments and disgraces have made for lurid headlines many ordinary people also recognise something of the narrative arc of their own families trials and tribulations Every family has its letdowns its tricky relatives they dont want to invite to the wedding Such dilemmas come to us all royal and commoner alike Indeed the selfabsorbed antics of her grandson Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle only swelled affection for the Queen at the great age of and recently widowed after the death of her strength and stay Prince Philip The Sussexes decision to quit so soon into their royal lives only served to underscore the astonishing persistence of the Queens service to the nation It also revealed something of what that service actually amounts to in spite of the sneers of those opposed to the institution What Harry and Meghan couldnt stick for a few years the Queen has attended to day and daily for more than For all the palaces flunkeys foreign travel and police protection the sort of luxuries the Sussexes have successfully sought to retain HMQ has turned up on rainy mornings freezing afternoons and bonegrindingly weary evenings to the engagements others found tedious the old peoples homes hospitals factories and knitting circles At heart we all know we would never want the inexorable grind of her role Nowadays when people casually switch careers take a year out or work from home who seriously could countenance a career mapped out for years in advance When people talk of mindfulness mental health and downtime whod tolerate the relentless Press scrutiny When personal happiness is deemed paramount whod choose a life of service to others How remarkable that a sheltered young woman who ascended the throne at the age of should have had such foresight such commitment such stamina such an exemplary reign One of the least celebrated aspects of this exceptional woman has been her ability to hold firm in the face of incessant and ravenous global media attention Who else over that span of years has sustained such a focus of attention Who else has had to read the rooms and the runes as fashions and mores changed to remain relevant and most importantly of use It is hard to think of anyone with such a record of visibility And yet this diminutive woman has managed to hold the attention firmly for all those decades defying all the stereotypes which were meant to limit her influence and confine her impact simply because of her sex The Queen has defined leadership quietly but with a steely possession of values Those who fail to recognise this extraordinary quality are people who have no intention of crediting the force of a womans will in any environment Of course Northern Ireland has featured significantly in the Queens reign Her first visit was in as Princess Elizabeth with her parents to Stormont Her last planned visit to a centenary service in Armagh last October was reluctantly cancelled for health reasons In this place there is the assumption that all Protestants are born with a jingoistic fervour for all things royal swearing allegiance to the Crown at every opportunity In a crude sectarian slight its often portrayed as an unsophisticated and crass loyalty Running counter to that is the notion that Catholics loathe the monarchy and its trappings But real life is never as simple as that Just as there are some unionists with little if any interest in the royals so too are there nationalists who enjoy taking on royal appointments accept honours at the Palace and pore over Hello magazine Hugely popular TV shows like The Crown the film The Queen and a slew of royal documentaries have generated fresh interest in the Windsors too Among the older generation curiosity was always there across the divide The young princesses Elizabeth and Margaret were the glamorous celebrities of their day shown on Pathe news at the local picture house That interest never really waned Royal weddings and funerals were watched avidly if discreetly in nationalist homes just as many Protestant homes covertly tuned into Pope John Paul IIs visit to Ireland Indeed in recent times the ever more robust Christianity of Elizabeth II has built a bond with many Catholics in Ireland and elsewhere as much as it has heartened those of other faiths that there is indeed a place for transcendence and spirituality in her kingdom a place for God Survivors of the Queens generation also identify with her stoicism in the travails of old age her raised eyebrow at the preoccupations and follies of those who follow behind In my case as I imagine for many unionists my admiration and affection for the Queen stems not from any overt indoctrination but rather a sort of cultural osmosis I first became aware of the Queen shortly after starting primary school when we had a gala day to mark her Silver Jubilee in The festivities included a fancy dress contest I was a flower girl wearing a dress made by my mother and carrying a spectacular basket of flowers from my grandfathers garden There was a heatwave and I got sunstroke which rather put me off royal events for a few years But each Sunday our set prayers at my Church of Ireland included one for the Queen When we watched the Festival of Remembrance on TV the royal family were present On Christmas Day at the Queens Christmas broadcast was a mustwatch Invariably an aunt would pass comment on HMs rigout Growing up in the Troubles added another layer to all of this The royals were terrorist targets wherever they went but it was especially dangerous for them to visit Northern Ireland People appreciated their moraleboosting trips here When they flew in after atrocities such as Enniskillen they brought genuine comfort to the injured bereaved and bewildered Of all the many reasons to admire the Queen people here owe her a vast debt of gratitude for her work for peace and reconciliation in these islands Because Her Majesty is a victim of the Troubles too Her cousin Lord Mountbatten was murdered in an IRA attack on his fishing boat near Mullaghmore in Co Sligo His grandson Nicholas Knatchbull and Paul Maxwell a local teenager working as a boatman were also killed in the blast The Dowager Lady Brabourne died the following day That was the backdrop to the role Her Majesty played in bringing to the peace process the full symbolic weight of the Crown There were three critical and choreographed interventions by the Queen in quick succession beginning with her visit to Ireland in which cannot be underestimated though it has been again by those who choose to underplay the potency of this womans presence During her Diamond Jubilee in the epic journey made by the Queen from the Anglican St Macartins Cathedral to St Michaels Catholic Church in Enniskillen was one of only a few steps across the street but bridged centuries and borders During that same visit the famous handshake she shared with Martin McGuinness in Belfast was another moment of intense symbolic import one which enacted on her own behalf and for many bereaved a certain moral force which it is impossible to mimic and which it was clear the Sinn Fein deputy first minister understood That encouraged what was a major and difficult step for republicans in Mr McGuinness attended the banquet in Windsor Castle to mark President Higginss state visit to the UK Again that was a hugely anticipated moment again symbolic and the event was handled with supreme aplomb by all parties especially the woman whom republicans had dubbed ElizaBrit and had as a war target for years with her massive and courageous heart taken more risks than anyone who had lost loved ones could be expected to take on There are any number of mouthy people among us pundits and opinioneers whose job it seems to be to make us feel more anxious less secure more upset and this extends even to some of the most horrific social media abuse of this gentle and faithful person who has navigated her way through a lifetime of doing for others albeit in a gilded cage In the midst of a throng of people even among thousands we will look to pick out the shock of violet or lime green the lemon yellow or elegant cerise which lets us know the monarch is on her way towards us with her words of interest comfort reassurance support She is still making her way towards us Long may she continue to do so God save her indeed People here owe her a vast debt of gratitude for her work for peace and reconciliation in these islands Every family has its letdowns its tricky relatives they dont want to invite to the wedding Such dilemmas come to us all

473,../data/sec_IRL/Belfast Telegraph/Factiva-20230807-170, A magical history tour Maureen Coleman Wörter Juni   National   Independent  Media Northern Ireland Maureen Coleman visited the Boyne Valley to experience its sacred landscape If the name Annagassan sounds vaguely familiar its likely youve heard of its mythical past and strong links to the Vikings Folklore decreed that the small village in Co Louth near Castlebellingham was the site of Linn Duachaill one of Irelands first Viking settlements and a rival to Dubh Linn Dublin in significance and size According to local legend the Vikings arrived in Ireland around and set up two bases one in Dublin and a second that had been lost in the mists of time But in a group of archaeologists and local historians determined to prove its existence carried out extensive field work and test digs and discovered a huge fortified settlement up to acres in size dating back to Viking times Not surprisingly the residents of Annagassan are proud that Linn Duachaill exists and is perfectly preserved underneath farmland in the village For this is a mythical place and not just Annagassan The Boyne Valley wellknown in the North for its connections to William of Orange and his victory over King James II in is a sacred landscape of medieval castles monuments and monastic sites high kings and UNESCO World Heritage Sites Our Boyne Valley adventure began with a pitstop for food at the Glyde Inn in Annagassan a familyrun multiawardwinning restaurantpub overlooking Dundalk Bay the Cooley and Mourne Mountains The restaurant is famed for its seafood and director Conor ONeill was keen for us to try the seafood platter What was presented to us was a fresh feast fit for a Viking razor clams oysters mussels prawns and crab toes all locally sourced The owners of the Glyde Inn have cleverly capitalised on its heritage with a new virtual reality experience taking visitors back in time to the arrival of the Vikings in Ireland As we sat at a specially commissioned Viking table wearing a VR headset we were transported from longboat to land with the story of settlement in the area narrated through the eyes of Bjorn the Bear In the early days of the settlements in Linn Duachaill and Dublin both competed for supremacy with the latter prevailing Its hard to imagine that had Linn Duachaill not been abandoned Dublin might not be Irelands capital now Less than half an hour from Annagassan is the medieval town of Drogheda an ideal base from which to explore the Boyne Valley As a frequent visitor to Dublin Drogheda has long been a place I just passed through en route My only visit to the town was as a child when my mum brought us to St Peters Church to view the decapitated head of Oliver Plunkett I remember being slightly horrified by the sight of the severed saints head enclosed in a shrine in the beautiful church Relics are a tangible link to the past and Drogheda like the rest of the Boyne Valley is steeped in rich history But theres so much more to the walled town than its legends myths and ancient sites Its also vibrant and welcoming with plenty of shops restaurants and bars Our base for the weekend was Scholars Townhouse a former Christian Brothers house which has been transformed into a boutique hotel Dating back to the townhouse is modern and comfortable yet retains its bygone charm with stained glass windows and high coved ceilings The areas history is depicted in its artwork with a portrait of King Billy himself taking pride of place on the stairway wall The hotel has character and hospitable staff After a night on the gin making that is not drinking we returned to find the restaurant had closed but the general manager Mark McGowan rustled us up a gorgeous cheeseboard with pates and freshly baked bread Breakfast was served in the awardwinning restaurant and was spot on The hotel can be hard to find through a maze of streets but has plenty of parking and is handy to a few lively pubs including the nearby Peggy Moores I really liked this hotel it has its own unique unpretentious vibe and a cosy bar which gets fairly busy at night That evening we were booked into Listoke Distillery and Gin School at Monasterboice a familyrun business which diversified into producing hand sanitiser at the height of the Covid pandemic Visitors to the gin school are given a guided tour of the distillery from the production of Listoke Gin to the botanicals made and the bottling line in place Its a hugely popular night out for couples hen parties tourists and not surprisingly gin lovers who get the chance to choose their own recipes and distil their own signature gin Now I have a confession to make Im not a gin drinker Many years ago I overindulged and paid a hefty price Id never touched gin before and wasnt aware of its potency but the evening ended with me dancing in the street around sing ing Ooh ah Cantona and waking up the neighbours The following day I suffered the hangover from hell I havent touched gin since I was slightly apprehensive about admitting this to the lovely people at Listoke but as it turned out my aversion to gin was cured with that one trip back to school Who knew I had a couple of refreshing GTs with my fellow distillers during the fully immersive threehour lesson and thoroughly enjoyed the experience of crafting my own drink even if the gin room did resemble a chemistry lab Studying the properties of solids liquids and gases was never this much fun though Four large glass jars on a table in the centre of the room contained juniper coriander angelica root and orris root the starting base for the gin It was up to us to then pick from a selection of citrus floral and spicy ingredients to add to the base My friend Michelle opted for a spicier concoction but I went for cornflower hibiscus and mango playing it safe with fruitier floral flavours While our gin boiled in large copper stills we were treated to a tour of the distillery followed by some locally sourced nibbles to accompany our GTs The group included a Cork woman and her American friend whose longawaited trip to Listoke had been delayed due to Covid and a couple on a date night Listoke still bottle and label their products by hand and we were asked to suggest a name for our brand Initially I considered Gemmas Gin as a gift for my eponymous aunt who enjoys the odd tipple with her friends Instead I called it after our family pub which was blown up during the Troubles Conways Gin has a nice ring to it Listokes trademark owl was then placed on the back of the bottle Having learned the hard way that too much gin might not make you sin but certainly lose all sense of decorum we took it easy that night and woke up fresh and raring to go the next day It was just as well as we had booked a guided walking tour of the town following a visit to the Highlanes Gallery Situated beside Droghedas AngloNorman St Laurences Gate Highlanes Municipal Art Gallery is a dedicated visual art space large open plan and airy It was formerly the site of Droghedas Franciscan Church and part of the friary gifted to the townsfolk when the Franciscans ended their association Drogheda in Like much of the town it combines character and history with modern design The stateoftheart facility presents a programme of national and international temporary exhibitions as well as exhibitions drawn from the Drogheda Municipal Art Collection Curator and CEO of the gallery Aoife Ruane led us around the building and to the space in the gallery which hosts a special exhibition of work by Droghedaborn artist Nano Reid Last year marked the anniversary of the death of Reid considered one of Irelands most accomplished artists of the century The exhibition presents over of Nanos works borrowed from major public collections such as the National Gallery of Ireland as well as many private collections If you want to know more about the life and works of Nano Reid who forged her way through the maledominated artistic landscape local guide Brendan Matthews is the man to speak to Not just an expert on all things Nano Reid Brendan has a wealth of knowledge about Droghedas origins and colourful past His walking tour brought us to the public house premises where Nano was born and to one of her former studios Along the route Brendan also talked us through the old medieval industries and trades connected with the markets area and explained how Drogheda was once made up of two towns that united as one in These days the River Boyne continues to divide the town between the Catholic Church dioceses of Armagh and Meath Brendan then brought us to St Peters Church of Ireland church built on a site which has been a centre of worship at least since the founding of the town of Drogheda itself During the Siege of Drogheda in Oliver Cromwells Parliamentary forces burned the steeple of the church where about people had taken refuge Cromwells army perhaps driven by guilt later donated £ for the repairs of St Peters as well as St Patricks in Armagh and St Patricks in Dublin The churchyard is a haven of interesting monuments including two cadavers enclosed in shrouds which are built into the churchyard wall and are believed to date back to the century The cadavers are partially opened to show the remains of the occupants of the tomb Sir Edmond Goldyng and his wife Elizabeth fascinating stuff but fairly mcabre After lunch at the pretty Lime Kiln gastro pub in Julianstown a quaint eaterie with tasty food and a vast array of craft beers and cocktails we had been hoping to travel in style down the historic Boyne with Boyne Boats Unfortunately due to delays and traffic jams we missed out on the trip For families planning a visit to the area this is a mustdo a paddling tour in handcrafted traditional Kerry Naomhog currachs which have featured in the HBO fantasy TV show Game of Thrones There are plenty of activities to keep the children amused if youre planning a staycation in the area Aside from the nature trails and outdoor activities Port Beach located near the fishing village of Clogherhead is a beautiful blue flag cove with wide sandy shores and a wide range of flora and fauna including the Marsh Orchid For the energetic why not give kayaking or gokarting a go If hikings more your thing check out the nature trails throughout the valley or trek up the Hill of Slane the Boyne Valley Camino along the river or the Navan Sculpture Trail featuring public art features That evening we dined in West Street a bar and restaurant in the heart of Drogheda town Voted in the top restaurants in Ireland shortly after opening in June it incorporates four indoor and outdoor spaces within the same building as well as a Mexican meets European menu The bar is renowned locally for its extensive list of specialised cocktails which owner Nigel Kerr insisted we try Well it wouldve been rude not to One cant write about a place without first sampling its produce As the gateway to the Boyne Valley region Drogheda is a good centre from which to visit places like Newgrange a Neolithic monument and the jewel in the crown of Irelands Ancient East the old Mellifont Abbey the historic towns of Navan Trim Slane and Kells and the Battle of the Boyne site at Oldbridge which holds so much significance for many people in Northern Ireland who commemorate William of Oranges triumph in battle every July The Boyne Valley is undoubtedly rich in history and legend with countless throwbacks to bygone times Monuments Martello towers battle sites and museums set the region apart and Droghedas skyline is dotted with steeples and spires But while the past is ever present the town itself is looking to the future with recent ventures such as West Street adding its name to a growing list of restaurants and pubs And its the hospitality that really makes the Boyne Valley worth a visit The Vikings certainly recognised its potential when they arrived at Linn Duachaill in the century to set up base These days expect a warm and friendly welcome in this ancient land of folklore and fairy tales Scholars current special offers are available on the Boyne website and their rack rate is currently € with a freshly cooked breakfast Afternoon tea is € with prosecco on arrival

Ireland THOUGHT FOR THE WEEKEND Reverend Lynne Gibson St Marks Church Ballymacash Lisburn IN churches which follow a lectionary the Old Testament reading this Sunday for many will be the story of Elijahs encounter with the God of the still small voice on Mount Horeb Scripture is punctuated with mountaintop encounters with God and yet there is something about Elijahs experience that resonates with us today Elijah wasnt out for a Sunday afternoon stroll or nor even as a prophet was he on a pilgrimage to seek God Instead in his own words he had reached the end of his ministry and the end of his tether He had stood up for what was right and had confronted false prophets He had angered Jezebel and his life was in danger So he fled travelling a full days journey into the wilderness sat down and asked to die Here was a leader a man of God who was exhausted burnt out and ready to give up I have lost count of the number of people from whom I have heard in recent days who are absent from work through stress or who have resigned from their jobs and given up on their vocation The pandemic it seems has a new swathe of casualties largely those in caring roles teachers medics and clergy who have carried much of the burden of leadership and care for the past two years pastoring teaching and supporting others through lockdowns and restrictions Like those navigating a group through a strange country without a map or guide many have been left exhausted experiencing a kind of reentry syndrome as they struggle to adjust to the new normal For Elijah it was at the very time that he was most tempted to give up that God drew closest to him As he lay under the tree God ministered first to his physical needs with good food and plenty of rest only afterwards challenging him for running away and hiding Even then there was no punishment but only a powerful reminder both that God is present in all that life throws at us and that all of us not least those who lead and care for others need care and compassion We need to be as kind and compassionate to ourselves as to others to pause and to listen for the still small voice after the storms and to await the healing touch of a God of compassion In conversation with JOHN KIRKPATRICK The Reverend Dr John Kirkpatrick will be installed as the new Presbyterian Moderator at the Opening of this years General Assembly in Belfast on June me about your background QTell AI am one of three children and my parents separated when I was three My mother died when I was and for six years I was a boarder at Coleraine Academical Institution I went to Greenmount Agricultural College to study farm management from and I studied at the New University of Ulster from specialising in Social Science and Environmental Science I felt a call for the ministry and after studying at Belfast Bible College I attended Union Theological College from I am married to Joan and we have four children and five grandchildren My father and grandfather were both Presbyterian ministers Q What about your clerical career A In I was ordained as Assistant Minister at Megain Memorial and Mersey Street Presbyterian Churches in east Belfast and in I became minister at Garryduff Presbyterian Church outside Ballymoney Six years later I was installed as minister of Portrush Presbyterian Church where I served for nearly years before my recent retirement I have a great interest in motorbikes and since I have been Race Chaplain to the Motor Cycle Union of Ireland I also enjoy walks gardening and beekeeping Q How and when did you come to faith AI might speak of becoming aware of the reality of God as personal and then beginning to respond That was both a process and perhaps included some crises My earliest memories of being conscious of faith date back to being eight or nine My direct influences were my mothers lived faith and the opportunities to hear truth in Christian Endeavour but doubtless there were many indirect influences such as the prayers of others your faith only for Sundays QIs A My relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ is integral with all of my life in every aspect It is always a challenge to remember not to separate any part of my life from my faith since I believe that I am united by faith to Jesus It is impossible to have life without Him and although I cannot lose this I can lose the sense of this or the blessing of this by my unrepentant daily sin Q Have you ever had a gnawing doubt or a crisis of faith A All of my life I have wrestled with questions and often I am in the middle of working out some things but I would not describe this as a crisis It would only be a crisis if I didnt realise that this is the normal Christian life Q Have you ever been angry with God and if so why A In all honesty I dont recall this as a response but maybe surprised maybe finding waiting difficult Q Do you ever get criticised for your faith and if so can you handle this A Sometimes I get reactions of cynicism anger and dismissiveness but not so much public or criticism for believing Perhaps this is partly because I invite questions and I want to create space for people to ask questions no matter how contradictory they maybe of my faith Q Are you ever ashamed of your own church or denomination A Since the Church is made up of changed but not perfect people there will always be flaws and failures so I am truly sorry when I see these unacknowledged and unrepented But this is actually one of the hopeful things too Q Are you afraid to die or can you look beyond death AI might not look forward to the process of dying and leaving temporarily those I love but I have great hope based on the promises of the Gospel and the resurrection of Jesus Q Do you believe in a resurrection and if so what will it be like A It is central to my faith I believe that John helps me to see something of what this will mean a real body real conversation real relationships and real love Q What about people of other faiths and denominations AI see only believers in the Lord Jesus and those who do not I believe that there are core truths about the Gospel that we agree on and there are things which we can agree to disagree about in a respectful way Q Would you be comfortable in stepping out from your own faith and trying to learn something from other people A Attempting to be a Christian apologist I try to do this regularly by listening to other people genuinely to engage with their view Q Are the churches here fulfilling their mission A In measure but if the mission is to love God and love your neighbour then aiming for and pursuing it is the mission being achieved ongoing Q Why are so many turning their backs on organised religion A This question has a number of presuppositions that would take too long to address in the space available here Q Has religion helped or hindered in Northern Ireland AI have always seen my goal as helping to rescue people from religiondefined as peoples attempts to earn Gods favour by themselves Q Some personal preferences favourite film book and music AJim Carrey in The Truman Show was a really good film to watch and an interesting concept Authors Amor Towles Lincoln Highway and Elizabeth Strout I like many music genres including Mark Knopfler and JJ Heller Q Where do you feel closest to God have no special place AI Q The inscription on your gravestone AThe facts any major regrets QFinally A Some small ones but nothing major We need to be as kind and compassionate to ourselves as to others to listen for the still small voice after the storms

And there was the fist on the ends of buildings This was a year after the Free Presbyterian Church had launched their own campaign Save Ulster from Sodomy attracting signatories Tom viewed this as a challenge It was very enjoyable breaking the law in Belfast he later recalled At the end of the year he gave his proceeds from a Christmas Eve charity gig to the Northern Ireland Gay Rights Association The first Gay Pride march took place in Belfast in This years festival has events over days including the Pride Céilí Britneyfest a Rocky Horror singalong and a showgirl extravaganza Dan ORawe is going to be part of the anniversary Belfast Pride Parade on July He plays sport for the first queer GAA team in the north Aeracha Uladh It was set up by Martin Murray who moonlights as the drag artist Danu Variant The team will wave to the crowds and Dan ORawe who had no previous experience in the sport is already excited The queerer you are the busier you are in this month he laughs Pride Week especially Dan is chiefly known as a songwriter performer and musician He plays drums with Dig Daisy and also worked with the sadly defunct queer country act Cryan But we celebrate him most of all as the creator of an electronic act called FRUITY To date the FRUITY catalogue includes a swirling DIY debut Not Quite Exceptional and then a selftitled EP in He mixes pop with woozy senses and beats Its not unlike the sound explorations of an act like Blood Orange Dan is hardly a quiet retiring artist and the name of his artistic project is willfully playful FRUITY works on many levels For a start hes reclaiming a word that has been used to denigrate outsiders in the heteronormative world I havent heard anyone calling me fruity offensively in a long time but it used to be a slur when you were in school Like queer as well Also I think FRUITY is quite a fun name Fruit brings fresh to mind He has new music on his stall a tune called Cavities Again it sounds a bit dizzy and strange It was made for a new compilation called Bangers N Pride The brief was big and queer he explains Bangers N Pride is the third in a series of compilations Each of these has put a value on the music community and the power to mobilise for a cause The first one Bangers N Mash Ups was released during lockdown in and recognised that domestic violence was escalating The proceeds went to an aid resource She Sells Sanctuary The followup Bangers N Break Ups was a Valentines Day offering a fundraiser for the same cause Released on the Bandcamp platform each of these compilations also provided a snapshot of a music scene under a pandemic with few options to play live and be seen The beneficiary of the new album Bangers N Pride is the Rainbow Project dedicated to the wellbeing of the LGBTQIA community As before it had been brought together by the band Problem Patterns a vital energy source for music activism They source the tracks from musician friends and organise the artwork and logistics Ciara King from the band offers an explanation The inspiration for this years compilation to be Pridethemed is that we are facing our first public Pride since the pandemic It is a march and public protestcelebration that I have never missed since first realising I was queer as a teenager and I guess we wanted to gather the voices of the queer musicians we have here and now and capture that moment now We have had more musicians now expressing their queerness even since we first started four years ago and its beautiful We are donating all our proceeds to the Rainbow Project because we feel as an entirely queer band that we would love to help our own community in whatever way that we can Any donation makes a difference and we thought what a nice fun celebratory way for our queer music scene to put our best assets to use in aiding the ones in our community that need it most Bangers N Pride is released on Friday July via Bandcamp Belfast Pride festival runs July We thought what a nice fun way for our scene to put our best assets to use 
483,../data/sec_IRL/Belfast Telegraph/Factiva-20230807-170, Construction finally gets underway on the new Islamic Centre in Belfast Kurtis Reid Wörter August   National   Independent  Media Northern Ireland Charity waited six years for the project to begin THE longdelayed construction of a new Belfast Islamic Centre has finally started this week more than six years after it was first announced It will be located on University Avenue south Belfast just minutes from where the charitable organisation currently operates in Wellington Park and is set to be completed next year Construction on the new building was announced in a joint statement on Monday by the Belfast Islamic Centre BIC charity and the Belfastbased company Mascott Construction Europe Limited which has been awarded the contract Shoaib Tareen who is leading the project on behalf of BIC told the  he was very pleased to announce the start of the refurbishment process This is a moment of immense joy for the Islamic community of Northern Ireland The Islamic community here had the desire for a larger premises for over two decades but that remained a challenging task he said With the communitys generous support over those years and with additional support from the Department for Communities and Belfast City Council we are finally able to kickstart the project In an interview with the Sunday Independent in May Mr Tareen criticised the delays which had held up the project He said There is a lot of resentment around the delays to the opening of our new centre and we feel that not enough is being done to help the Muslim community here The old centre was subject to attacks several times over the past decade In a paint bomb was thrown at the centre while in September red paint was daubed on the front door of the building In December pieces of pork a meat which Muslims refrain from eating were thrown through the door of the centre The BIC was first established in Belfast more than years ago and is linked to the Muslim Council of Great Britain Its primary function is to promote the benefits of the Muslim community in Northern Ireland through education and resources including prayer facilities Mascott Construction Europe also said they are delighted to be working with Belfast Islamic Centre Belfast City Council CBS Consulting and Taylor Boyd on this prestigious project The new location in the former Aldersgate House which was purchased by the centre in for £ is to feature a dropin centre educational facilities and a coffee shop open to the public The centre originally announced its plans to move to new premises in January after saying its current location was not fit for purpose due to the age of the building The building is an older Victorianstyle home which was converted In a screening application the Belfast Islamic Centre said its current location has room limitations which restricts the range of cultural social and recreational activities which have to be outsourced It also said the building is in a poor state of repair which discourages attendance and added the building doesnt have suitable disabled or mobility access Plans to develop the new centre began in May after the centre received a £ grant to help with refurbishments from the Department for Communities after a full assessment and screening The grant covers the cultural aspects of the centre and not the religious elements with one floor of the new building dedicated to religious space the construction of which will not receive any public funds Other funds have been raised directly by the centre including via a crowdfunding page which currently stands at over £ The total costs of refurbishment stands at around £ Plans went on to be delayed multiple times with the centre citing a lack of funds and the Covid pandemic The new threestorey centre which is set to retain the name Belfast Islamic Centre will primarily offer resources for the Islamic community but is also set to offer a location for interfaith and intercultural dialogue and debate The centre also plans to offer motherandbaby classes English and Arabic lessons resources for older people a youth club and a food bank The exact number of Muslims living in Northern Ireland is unknown but its believed to be just over Many areas located near the new centre including the Botanic and Holyland districts have a large Muslim population SDLP councillor for the area Gary McKeown said news that work is beginning on the new Belfast Islamic Centre is very welcome South Belfast is a thriving diverse community and this centre will provide a location which finally meets the needs of the Islamic community Over recent years we have seen our city really develop as a place that people from all over the world make their home so it is very important that these residents have the facilities here to support them and make them feel welcome he said The Green Partys councillor for the area Aine Groogan also said she was delighted to see work beginning on the new Islamic centre I know the Islamic community in Belfast had long since outgrown their previous place of worship so this is long overdue I hope that this new community hub will allow Belfast Islamic Centre to continue to develop to provide space and support for a growing community here in Belfast and indeed across Northern Ireland she said Its estimated that the work will be complete by July Its important that residents have the facilities here to make them feel welcome 
484,../data/sec_IRL/Belfast Telegraph/Factiva-20230807-170,Features Why it all went wrong for Marvel and how the studio can fix it Deirdre Molumby Wörter August   National   Independent  Media Northern Ireland Since the high point of the brilliant Avengers Endgame repetition and predictability have dominated Perhaps it is time the company took a deep breath and reassessed writes Deirdre Molumby THE year was a big one for cinema and not just because it preceded the pandemic that frightening time when the future of movie theatres looked bleak It was the year that brought us Avengers Endgame which became the highestgrossing movie of all time until it was surpassed by the rerelease of Avatar For Endgame to accomplish such a feat it needed to attract not only Marvel fans who would loyally watch the movie over and over but it would also need to bring in a far wider audience those cinemagoers who may have only seen a couple of Marvel movies if any at all Such was the momentum around Endgame that everyone was talking about the movie If you wanted to stay in the conversation you had to see it Avengers Endgame was the culmination of movies over years a journey that began with Iron Man a film which both hailed a major career comeback for its star Robert Downey Jr and kicked off the franchise with flair After that there were solo movies following Avengers characters such as Captain America and Thor A big indication that Marvel was on to a winning formula came when the solo characters got together in the first Avengers movie It grossed £ in Chief executive Kevin Feige and the rest of the gang at Marvel Entertainment had a distinct plan for the Marvel Cinematic Universe or MCU back then Yes there were offshoot movies that looked at characters such as Black Panther Guardians Of The Galaxy or Captain Marvel but all roads led these heroes to joining a definitive battle Infinity War After that came the aptly titled Endgame Avengers Infinity War was an emotional knock to Marvel fans as the film saw their favourite heroes lose in the fight against the villainous Thanos Sure there was a bit of suspension of disbelief that the good guys may not actually win But the victory of Endgame was made all the more affecting as our heroes literally had to rise from the ashes to claim victory As with any war there were sacrifices along the way Endgame marked the end of the road for fan favourites Iron Man Captain America and Black Widow aside from her solo movie Now it was up to other characters to take up the mantle and lead As with anything that comes to an end the question that followed was what next For Marvel the answer was television While it put its movie release schedule into chaos the pandemic in some ways worked well for Marvel With everyone stuck at home there were several series that kept them entertained particularly when the Netflix options were growing thin Marvel fans were hungry for more of their beloved shared universe while others were just eager for any content at all Across MCU shows were flying out on streaming service Disney WandaVision The Falcon And The Winter Soldier Loki What If and Hawkeye all debuted last year The critical reception was generally favourable but at this point Marvel was still working with dregs of characters left alive whose stories werent finished after Endgame Moreover while the head honchos at Marvel were boasting about viewing figures up to and including Loki the word on numbers tuning in then started to get quiet In the latter half of the world was emerging from the pandemic which partly explains the trend of viewers tuning out But there was also a recognition that the content was becoming less interesting and more formulaic Marvel shows no signs of slow ing down its output In the past few months alone there has been three new MCU series Moon Knight Ms Marvel and SheHulk Attorney At Law as well as two Christmas specials on Disney by the time concludes Its cinema efforts have proven just as rapid Black Widow ShangChi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings Eternals SpiderMan No Way Home Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness and Thor Love And Thunder were all released in a year Of course theres the argument that due to delays caused by the pandemic there was a content buildup and now were seeing it all at once Nonetheless theres a ceaselessness to the pace at which the MCU turns over projects Theres always a new series or film on the horizon Theres barely any time for critical appraisal before Marvel is on to the next thing You could say the MCUs only endgame now is being a churning wheel of content completely oversaturating the market Its trying to accommodate everyone with a variety of options However the balance of rewarding longtime fans and appealing to a wide audience isnt being accomplished any more Marvel fatigue is real and the moneygrabbing intentions behind the whole MCU project are so transparent that it sullies everything the studio produces In Marvels defence though it took far too long to get there there have at least been more efforts at diversity of late including having its first Muslimled superhero series in Ms Marvel Yet one must protest at the studios claims of pushing boundaries with form and genre such as the science fiction and time travel elements of Loki spy thriller characteristics in Black Widow and legal drama in She Hulk When every single story goes through the same formula ordinary person gains powers hero encounters crisis hero has final battle to save the day how innovative is it really The Avengers run of characters were too often male superheroes with rocking bods and daddy issues But at least you could believe in their growth as characters and in the chemistry the actors shared Many are still synony mous with those roles Robert Downey Jr will always be seen as Iron Man Chris Hemsworth as Thor and Chris Evans as Captain America Moreover there was the satisfaction of rooting for a team something the recent Eternals totally failed to recreate There is an overreliance on knowing references and injokes in Marvel shows and movies each obliged to have some connection to a prior and future intellectual property Its a phony and cheap means of appealing to fans One of the studios better TV efforts is Ms Marvel because it doesnt rely on ties to other MCU characters It feels genuinely fresh energetic and fun integrating a fascinating commentary on what it means to be a young PakistaniAmerican in the modern day and the history of trauma that comes with it With so many shows and movies there are far too many characters now not to mention the fact that we now have multiple timelines and universes to keep up with It leaves a bad taste in your mouth when you feel like youre sinking hour after hour into consuming content that amounts to nothing Repetition and predictability dominate Theres no risk or sense of excitement Avengers Endgame was perhaps too epic for its own good because all of the MCU has followed pale in comparison Theres no next event which all these shows and movies are building towards and thus no real suspense or anticipation In fact its no surprise that the most commercially successful project of Marvel since Endgame has been SpiderMan No Way Home which grossed £ and was the highestgrossing film of This ode to fans saw characters across Marvel and previous SpiderMan movies star and fight alongside and against one another Moviegoers delighted in seeing the joint forces of Tom Holland Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire iterations of SpiderMan the latter of which dates as far back as Marvel has announced numerous future TV and movie projects in their next phases and they are dominated by sequels and tieins roping fans into an endless cycle of the same thing What the studio could really benefit from at this stage is to give its current projects a beat to breathe assess which are working and which are not and be choosier with future projects In other words the MCU could follow the lead of Thanos yes the supervillain who wiped out half the universe so that resources could be properly allocated for the greater good The overreliance of knowing injokes and references is a cheap means of appealing to fans

Northern Ireland At an average of £ treat is still a staple amid the costofliving crisis THE costofliving crisis may be influencing wedding trends in Northern Ireland but it hasnt managed to topple the cake from its central role on the big day The owner of Causeway Treats which has stores in Portstewart and Belfast and delivers throughout the region has endured a difficult year of trading after the cost of ingredients soared in price Sean admits he had to seriously consider whether it was worth continuing after being hit by what he described as a double whammy of problems Its been a pretty stressful year and weve had to make a lot of decisions because weve also seen our energy bills treble he said We import a lot of French unsalted butters and luxury chocolate that you cant buy in the supermarket These are the things that make people want to come back to us so we have to keep paying for them The bakery has been transparent about needing to pass the cost on to customers who are still more than willing to shell out for the perfect day However many brides and grooms have become a little bit more frugal Theres been a real trend towards a seminaked cake design added Sean who did not wish to have his surname published Its been quite amazing They wouldnt cost quite as much as theres less buttercream Its hard to know if the elegant rustic look is in or people just want to pay less The baker is receiving more requests to use fewer gold leaves and cut back on expensive cake toppers and sugar flowers More people are also placing orders for quirky angular designs such as topsyturvy cakes A lot of customers are asking for minimalistic cakes with less razzmatazz Sean explained They are interested in chic cakes which are less costly than having another tier Although social media types still want the big cakes they dont want to look like they are scrimping The price of basic ingredients such as butter and organic eggs has rocketed with substantial increases in the cost of goodquality vanilla paste and flour We only use Swiss meringue buttercream which tastes really good Sean said Using the hob to mix the egg white and sugar hits hard on the energy bill The rising cost of petrol and diesel has also meant the bakery which comes recommended by Titanic Hotel Belfast and The Merchant Hotel has had to increase its delivery fees by as much as £ Star baker Johnny Regan who won the Mount Charles Big School Cook Off in is a major draw for customers placing orders at the business He enjoys whipping up rustic wedding cakes more than traditional sponge designs I love getting the effect just right with the seminaked buttercream on the outside of the tiers and then decorating it with fresh berries and fresh flowers to get the right balance and look he said The rustic wooden slices are my favourite cake stands and they complement the rusticstyle cakes perfectly Ive always loved blending textures and flavours together to make tasty dishes of food and now love the challenge of creating something sweet with lovely flavours and colours that will make couples smile on their most important day The said more precision is required in baking compared to cooking meaning every step has to be perfect I just love watching the final wedding cake slowly emerge and it gets really exciting adding the final touches at the end he said I am constantly taking a step back and forth from the cake to make sure it will get a smile from the couple when they see it It feels a bit like a painter painting a picture and just knowing when to stop However as Sean expects the frugal trend to continue well into next year Johnnys ambitions may have to be temporarily tamed The wedding cake is a central fixture and needs to look well People are still prepared to spend an average of £ on it he explained Im optimistic that it will come back round again because theres bound to be a point where things correct themselves I think the wedding cake is safe but I will have more of an idea in January which is a big month for orders Humanist celebrant Stewart Holden believes couples would rather slash the guest list to ensure traditional fixtures retain their role in the nuptials The best way to make savings is to cut numbers say from to he said People had to do it during the pandemic and it seems to be the preference for those wanting to spend less There are no signs that anyone is cutting back on wedding dresses photography or the ceremony itself Mr Holden is seeing a yearonyear increase in demand in business which suggests more and more people are willing to splash out for a more personalised ceremony Its a fundamental part of the wedding day he said Church weddings tend to be formulaic and dont really capture the story of the couple I put in a lot of hours to draw out some intimacy and help couples have their own input on the day I imagine church weddings are cheaper but they can be quite impersonal People are willing to pay more for a different experience However the wedding officiant conceded that the true impact of the costofliving crisis will not become clear until and Thats because due to the average wedding being booked months in advance most wedding bills will have been paid before economic challenges began Christmas to Valentines Day is known as engagement season thats why venues have wedding fairs in January and February he explained It will be interesting to see if calls decrease because people are trying to save money I dont think its a change we will see immediately but I do wonder if couples will begin postponing plans because they need more time to save up or if those who get engaged in the current economic climate might decide to wait longer before getting married

closed tomorrow Easter Sunday Linda Stewart and Alf McCreary talk to leading ministers about coping with lockdown People are surprisingly well stoic in good form hurches across Northern Ireland lie shuttered this Easter weekend their pews empty their gates locked against the threat of coronavirus CAnd yet the life of congregations the length and breadth of the province goes on with ministers keen to maintain as much of a sense of normality as possible in these unprecedented times We spoke to wellknown clergymen about how a combination of cuttingedge technology and people power is keeping Church life going against all the odds Its encouraging people are pulling together Rev David Campton is superintendent of Methodist Circuit of South and Central Belfast with responsibility for five churches and Belfast Central Mission He is married to Sally and has two sons Ciaran who lives at home and Owain who is in lockdown in Glasgow He is formerly a hospital chaplain at the South Eastern Trust and was part of their preparedness team for the bird flu pandemic When I saw things going pearshaped in Wuhan I began to feel even at that stage that there was the prospect of major disruption here Rev Campton says A lot of preparedness work that was put in place at that point seems to be the pattern that they are following now An insulindependent diabetic Rev Campton and his family have been selfisolating for the last two weeks after a couple of his wifes colleagues developed symptoms and she developed a cough He has been coordinating the work of his churches across Belfast from home Like many other ministers I in coordination with others have been trying to master all sorts of technology to deliver limited services of worship online he explains He has been using a combination of Facebook and YouTube to stream services and is circulating resources by email A lot of our congregation are older and wouldnt necessarily have all been computerliterate Some of them arent online at all so we had to produce some physsome ical resources to post to people as well he says Just this week Ive done an email for Holy Week and Easter and the whole of April which we hope will help to sustain those who will not necessarily be able to go online On the pastoral side the Church has been cascading support grouping congregations so that they will support each other The message coming in seems to be that people are pulling together and that is encouraging to hear and to witness he says Tight restrictions for funerals have been brought in allowing no more than six people to be present and if anyone has had any contact with the deceased ahead of time they cannot be at the funeral Its very very difficult for those who lost loved ones and we are trying to be proactive and plan ahead of time talking about counselling and supporting those who may be bereaved Part of that is discussing suitable dates in the future for holding memorial services rather than having a surge of services immediately after lockdown is lifted Weddings and baptisms have stopped but the Methodist Church has granted temporary dispensation to conduct remote communion by livelink only Its very much a temporary solution Within the Methodist Church we are used to being relatively pragmatic about our theology John Wesley was renowned for being prepared to bend the rules when he had to Rev Campton says But it must be a livelink and it cannot be a recorded service to have a DIY communion when you want to The Church is encouraging people to switch their donations online but Rev Campton says many older people are keeping their collection envelopes until they can give them in person I would be careful to say if you are keeping your envelopes keep them secure and dont advertise the fact We wouldnt want anybody being taken advantage of in all of this there are always people out there who will make a bad situation worse He is keen to see the new and more systematic support networks continue after the crisis Its probably reinforced something that were talking about in the past and it hasnt always happened But he doubts he will continue to be a devotee of online services My feeling about worship and preaching has always been that its not a spectator sport its participatory and of the moment Its okay as long as there is sense of buyin and engagement in what is going on its not like watching EastEnders or a concert online Weve tried to encourage as many people as possible across the circuit to be faces on the screen to make it seem as if its not something that just ministers do We want people involved and that means people in their own homes We have become a church without walls Rev Mervyn Jamison of Holy Trinity Church in Ballylesson Drumbo is in lockdown with his wife Rosemary sons David and Rory and daughter Rosalind In the first week of the lockdown Rev Mervyn Jamison says a food collection had been planned and instead the doors of the churches were opened so people could drop off their donations The community gathered a quarter of a tonne of food which was donated to a food bank I can think of one local business that donated stuff because they had to close and couldnt make use of it Rev Jamison says They gave it to others even though they were facing financial constraints themselves For the first few Sundays he broadcast services from church but last Sunday it was broadcast from his home I strapped an iPhone to one of the old lampstands in the church and beamed out our own service It went out to an amazing diaspora from Ballylesson and Drumbo with people from America watching it The viewing figures on that were just phenomenal We usually average about people on a Sunday but on March there were something like viewers What is frustrating is not being able to see your people facetoface but we really have moved to a church without walls Never before have we been able to get our message into so many homes Facebook has proven its worth Rev Jamison has also been making a lot of phone calls to members of the congregation as CONTINUED ON PAGE CONTINUED FROM PAGE part of his pastoral care He has posted a number of videos on the churchs Facebook page and is also using textmessaging to keep in touch He printed out a reading plan for the congregation for Holy Week as well We sent out a reading plan so that people could go through Holy Week chronologically As this develops were going to have to look at more creative ways of trying to teach people Were struggling with people who dont have technology but most have mobile phones and we decided to text them the orders of service to keep them in the loop As many families and congregation members have lost income they havent been asked for a virtual collection Quite a few folk have direct debit which helps If this is prolonged we will look at it again However people continue to be generous towards their church which has amazed me during this time Baptism and weddings have been postponed but burials linked to are expected in the days to come Rev Jamison says they hope to continue with communion but without people having to leave their homes On Maundy Thursday where we celebrate the Last Supper where Jesus had that time with his disciples we had a little meal in our house and shared communion with each other he says He has suggested that people serve up Ribena or wine and bread and join his family online for a virtual Holy Communion service so that everyone feels they are taking part For Palm Sunday his plan was to preach from the palm tree in his garden instead of his office We encouraged the children to try to make crosses out of anything they could find in the house Fr Martin Magill is parish priest at St John the Evangelist on the Falls Road in Belfast One of the things Im finding is that more and more of the older parishioners are getting into the Facebook page says Fr Martin Magill I came up with a bit of a timetable Every morning will be a thought for the day and I ask people I know from across the Christian denominations to video a thought for the day which I ask them to send the day before and I put it up for the following morning At noon from Sunday to Saturday I celebrate a streamed Mass from the Facebook page and at is Good Afternoon St Johns I go on Zoom the online conferencing platform for about minutes and chat with people from the parish In the evening we have the Angelus and at a late Compline and that lasts minutes A number of people including members of the pastoral council are phoning parishioners to keep in contact particularly older people who dont have access to the internet From some of the direct contact Ive had people are doing surprisingly well Ive phoned a number of parishioners these are people who cant get out and every single one was very stoic and at this stage was in a very good form Fr Magill says I am just holding this one lightly but the fact that these people have had to endure the Troubles and have been through a lot in their lives theres a certain resilience there Fr Magill mentions one parishioner who was dying in one of the nursing homes and they made an exception so that he could pray with her We will not be visiting if a person is dying with or if there is someone in the house with it as well In those circumstances I would use the phone and say prayers at some distance Baptisms and marriages have all been postponed and funerals are simplified with a small number of immediate family members present at the graveside Services in Holy Week were much the same only with some parts omitted such as the washing of the feet and the procession on Holy Tuesday So far Mass has been broadcast from the parochial house and Fr Magill takes communion as part of that Im hoping I can figure out how to film in the church Ive been doing these streaming events from the parish house but I want to do them from the church Fr Magill says he hasnt had any major technology problems like the Italian priest who accidentally broadcast himself celebrating Mass with virtual bear ears appearing on his head I havent quite gone as far as that but Ive had a few wee moments here and there where it hasnt gone quite right for me but people have been very understanding He says he could see himself adopting some of the technology when the crisis is over not every day but possibly once a week Its a useful way to keep in contact with parishioners and Im probably getting to know parishioners in a different way and that has been useful Rev David Cupples of Enniskillen Presbyterian Church is married to Rosie and has two children Ellen and Peter ev David Cupples says the realisation of what was coming probably hit around March We had a service in church and I think we all realised that it was going to be the last time we would be meeting for a while he says The churches hadnt been closed formally at that time but we knew in our hearts that we wouldnt be meeting for the foreseeable future I opened the service up to share thoughts and feelings and also to ask for names of people who had underlying health conditions and we prayed for them publicly Several days later all church meetings ceased and the challenge was how to keep in contact with the congregation and keep ministries going We have a system of practical help in place for those who are selfisolating arranged by two ladies in the church shopping prescriptions post that sort of thing for anyone who requests it Rev Cupples says Our elders have all been phoning around each family in their district asking how everybody is I think its probably increased our level of pastoral care and sense of caring in the church For myself I write lots of letters to healthcare professionals in the church business people and people with underlying health conditions Ive phoned lots and lots of people I also have most of the congregation on email and have seen them sending messages very regularly with songs thoughts and prayer topics We have a very good communication system in the church On the first Sunday of lockdown Rev Cupples broadcast a service via webcam from his home We have a student who is home from university and last week we upped our game immensely he recorded me doing a service in church on Saturday afternoon It broadcast online and on the YouTube channel from on Sunday In our church there are families with probably online but last Sunday service was viewed times Its obviously reaching a whole lot of people who are not in church on Sunday morning but we dont know who they are We have been asking people to post their offering to the church office in the meantime but we will look at this more thoroughly after Easter Rev Cupples says they have received guidance from the Presbyterian Church that communion baptism and weddings must stop until the crisis is over and there are particularly strict instructions around funerals No clergy are allowed anywhere near South West Acute Hospital in Enniskillen I am a hospital chaplain but Im not allowed on the premises and sadly anyone who goes into hospital is not allowed to be visited There are people who are really suffering and its going to be a time of great hardship Overall the pace of Church life has been slower and less frantic then normal Its good for Church life to be simpler and for people to ask what it is all about actually Its about worship its about studying Gods Word and caring for one another and we are still able to do all these things Rev Cupples explains Im really looking forward to the first Sunday back in church People will really appreciate being together I think when we are able to come back together face each other shake hands and see each other people will appreciate one another more I personally believe our Church will be more united and stronger at the end of it even if we are not back until September I hope the same will be true of society If we look at volunteering caring

578,../data/sec_IRL/Belfast Telegraph/Factiva-20230807-170, The Presbyterian radical who kept the slave ships out of Belfast Alf McCreary Wörter Juni   National   Independent  Media Northern Ireland Barely remembered today Thomas McCabe a United Irishman and abolitionist was the century precursor to Black Lives Matter writes Alf McCreary How Belfast had a key role in fight against slavery Many people from different political backgrounds will have been surprised to learn that the ardent Irish nationalist John Mitchel formerly of Newry was a strong supporter of slavery and that he backed the Confederate States in the American Civil War during which his two sons died fighting for the proslavery cause As a pupil of Newry Grammar School in the I was aware that John Mitchel was buried in a Presbyterian church cemetery in the town In my early teens I watched each autumn as a massive Apprentice Boys parade in Newry made its way to a Protestant church in a nationalist area partly because I loved to follow one or other of the excellent brass bands on the march It was only years later that I realised this parade was apparently a quid pro quo for an annual republican visit to the grave of Mitchel the son of a Presbyterian minister in a Protestant graveyard in the unionist part of the town Mitchel made the news recently when there were calls for Newry Mourne and Down District Council to rename a street in Newry called John Mitchel Place Currently there is an online petition asking the council to remove Mitchels statue to a place where his history and context can be more carefully assessed and to rename John Mitchel Place Black Lives Matter Plaza The statues and memorials of other wellknown historic Ulstermen are also under threat Amnesty International wants a namechange for Larnes McGarel Town Hall which was funded by Charles McGarel a slavedealer and sugar plantation owner There are also calls to remove the statue of the Co Down polymath Sir Hans Sloane a cofounder of the British Museum because he married into a family which owned slaves Even King William of Orange has been dragged into the controversy because he had shares in a company owned by the Bristol slaver Edward Colston whose statue was dumped in the citys harbour by protesters recently It was later retrieved from its watery grave and removed to a local museum However Mitchel was one of the most outspoken supporters of slavery A member of the Young Ireland group and the Irish Confederation he was convicted of treason in and sentenced to years penal servitude in Van Diemens land now Tasmania from where he escaped to America in Mitchel was in his own right a remarkable operator In Ireland he had already made his name as an activist author and political journalist so few people were surprised that when he reached New York he established a radical Irish nationalist newspaper The Citizen and became a leading apologist for slavery He wrote We deny that it is a crime or a wrong or even a peccadillo to hold slaves to buy slaves or to keep slaves to their work by flogging or other needful correction He also claimed that slavery was inherently moral and good in itself He further claimed that slaves in the southern states were better looked after than Irish cottiers and industrial workers in England In a blatantly racist remark he claimed that slaves were an innately inferior people and that he promoted slavery for its own sake His views were very unpopular among his colleagues in the Young Ireland movement back home and also among abolitionists everywhere including those in burgeoning America Mitchel was born near Dungiven in and when only was awarded a degree from Trinity College Dublin He was obviously a bright man and he must have been aware that only a couple of decades before he was born there had been a concerted and successful campaign to prevent slave ships docking in Belfast which perhaps makes Mitchels chilling views on slavery all the more extraordinary That Belfast antislavery campaign was led by Thomas McCabe who helped to prevent the formation of a slave ship company proposed in by prosperous local merchants including Waddell Cunningham and his business partner Thomas Gregg Their plan was to ship goods to the Gold Coast in Africa and fill their vessels with captured slaves who would then be transported to the West Indies and offloaded The vessels would then be filled with sugar and brandy destined for Belfast Slaving was a murky business at that time for other ports such as Bristol However Waddell Cunningham a leading citizen of Belfast and a former chairman of the Chamber of Commerce and his backers had no scruples Cunningham owned sugar estates in the West Indies and in he established along with Gregg the largest shipping company in New York Back in Belfast Waddell Cunningham was a formidable opponent of those who campaigned for the abolition of slavery He was a successful entrepreneur and a merchant and banker He was also a member of the Ballast Board from its inception in until his death in The Ballast Board was the precursor of the Belfast Harbour Board which continues to develop the port to the present day CONTINUED ON PAGE CONTINUED FROM PAGE Cunningham was a leading member of the Volunteer movement and opposed the Society of United Irishmen After his death he was buried in Newtownbreda with full military honours supplied by the Belfast and Castlereagh Yeoman Cavalry and Infantry A local newspaper obituarist described him as having a life of ardent and active exertions and a man who used his fortune in the most useful manner and to the most generous purposes Obituaries in those days often omitted their subjects failings In his prime Cunningham had enormous influence in Belfast and the symmetry of his plan to form a shipping company to transport slaves was inescapable But he had reckoned without the conscientious objections of other leading Belfast citizens who were vehemently opposed to slavery They included Thomas McCabe whose home The Vicinage was then on the site where St Malachys College now stands McCabe hosted meetings of the Belfast Charitable Society and the Society of United Irishmen there as a member of both organisations McCabe was a goldsmith and watchmaker with a business in North Street He was also a radical member of First Presbyterian Church in Rosemary Street at a time when the Presbyterian Church was in the vanguard of liberalism When Waddell Cunningham a meeting in the Exchange and Assembly Rooms in Waring Street in to establish a Belfast slave ship company Thomas McCabe walked the short distance from his shop in North Street to join the meeting He made an impassioned speech against the plan and uttered a warning which still echoes down Irish history today May God wither the hand and consign the name to eternal infamy of the man who will sign that document His speech caused a great stir and in the prevailing climate of Protestant liberalism it helped to carry the day and prevented the formation of a slavetrading company in Belfast Later McCabe wrote to Dr William Drennan another prominent Belfast citizen to tell him how that plan to establish a Belfast slaveship company had been aborted Drennan was also a man of great ability who had many interests One of his claims to fame was a masterly outline on how to deal with a pandemic an achievement which has a remarkable resonance for our world today Some of the United Irishmen were so opposed to slavery that they refused to eat sugar or drink rum from the West Indies because of the association with the slave trade To underline the prevailing opposition to slavery in Belfast in the famous freed slave Olaudah Equiano who wrote a bestselling book about his experiences was invited to Belfast by the United Irishmen and given a warm reception He reputedly sold nearly copies of his book The Interesting Narraheld tive of the Life of Olaudah Equiano or Gustavas Vassa the African during his stay when he lodged with the draper United Irishman and radical newspaper editor Samuel Neilson When Equiano left Belfast Neilsons Northern Star newspaper founded in continued to give wide coverage to antislavery propaganda Despite the best efforts of people like Thomas McCabe Mary Ann McCracken sister of the United Irishman Henry Joy McCracken and many others a large number of Belfast cobblers continued a brisk trade making broaderfitting shoes for slaves Other traders supplied commodities for slave owners in the West Indies and elsewhere In the antislave campaigner William Wilberforce was successful in getting legislation passed in the House of Commons to abolish slavery In the greatgreatgreatgreat grandson of William Wilberforce also called William visited First Presbyterian Church on the anniversary of the abolition of slavery He brought with him an iron casket presented to Wilberforce by former slaves in recognition of his dedication to the abolitionist cause It was forged from the shackles that the slaves had worn on sugar plantations In the current debate about race and the Black Lives Matter movement it is worth noting that because the efforts of Thomas McCabe and many other antislavery campaigners in the latter decades of the century Belfast retains the noble record of being one of the few major ports in the British Isles to have turned its face against the slave trade The story of Thomas McCabe the radical Presbyterian from Belfast and the challenges which he and his colleagues in the United Irishmen overcame to keep slave ships out of Belfast shows how complex that struggle was Modern attitudes to difficult historical subjects need to take account of what actually took place during those days if people are to make informed judgments about the best way to handle the dark residue of the past Alf McCreary is the author of Titanic Port An Illustrated History of Belfast Harbour Some were so opposed to it that they refused to drink West Indies rum

INSTANT CONNECTION ON FIRST DATE Fermanagh mumoftwo who survived car blaze on work faith and life with hubby Ray By Ivan Little MIRACLE mum Melanie Grimsley who survived a horrific car fire which claimed the life of her older sister years ago has opened her heart about finding love a second time around after the breakup of her first marriage to her teenage sweetheart Thirtyfouryearold Melanie from Kesh in Co Fermanagh says she couldnt be happier after tying the knot with health service professional Ray Maxwell who she met on a Christian dating site three years ago Melanie and her first husband Brian Higgins who have two sons together were divorced in five years after they were married in Enniskillen But the motheroftwo said she and Brian whos also from Fermanagh simply grew apart We were very young at the time of the wedding But theres no bad blood we all get on well now and Brian sees the boys regularly said Melanie who had been left with horrendous burns after the unexplained fire which swept through her mothers car in April when she popped into a shop in Enniskillen to buy milk Passerby Oliver Quinn bravely pulled Melanie from the inferno but he couldnt save her sister Amanda who was almost three Oliver was guest of honour at Melanies wedding which was the subject of a UTV documentary and she later wrote a book Beauty for Ashes about her long and painful road to recovery Melanie who had to endure cruel catcalling and stares because of her injuries later gained a first class honours degree in law after studying for three years at the Ulster Universitys Magee campus She was among the top students in her year and dedicated her dissertation to her late sister Amanda Melanie then embarked on an apprenticeship with Murnaghan Fee solicitors in Enniskillen who dealt with her compensation case after the fire But her dream of becoming a fullyfledged lawyer fell apart after the second part of her legal practices qualification course that she was expecting to attend in Derry was dropped by university officials and she said she got little notice that she would have to study instead in Belfast which is twice the distance from Kesh as Derry But with two sons to look after Melanie said she was heartbroken when her argument that she couldnt be expected to travel for over five hours every day was ignored and she was told that she couldnt work from home even for one or two days a week Ive always really dedicated myself to my studies and I could have succeeded with homeworking just as people are doing now because of the pandemic said Melanie who added that she felt she had no choice but to give up on her legal dreams However Melanie decided to move with her sons Leo and Will to Holywood Co Down in a bid to broaden the job opportunities open to her I also wanted a new chapter for me and the boys said Melanie I had lived my whole life in Kesh and I thought it would be good to spread my wings It was a big departure for me I didnt know anyone in Holywood and didnt even really know the town but because I am from Fermanagh I couldnt have lived somewhere that was landlocked I had to see water And I really love it here though I do miss Fermanagh In Melanie met Ray whos on a Christian dating website and after chatting to each other online and seeing their photographs and profiles the couple met up for a coffee in Belfast We talked for ages and there was just a connection between us said Melanie who added that Ray is a senior rehab worker for people with sensory disabilities and was based in Portadown Ray who also has two children from a previous marriage and Melanie tied the knot in June last year and live together in Holywood It was great that we had got to know each other for who we were not who we might have been before said Melanie Ray and I took things slowly at first for our childrens sake but hes a lot of fun and the boys enjoyed their time with him as well as loving the time with their dad at weekends Ray and I are very different in many ways but we are really compatible as well I think we knew we had clicked fairly quickly and we both realised there could be something longer term in our relationship Life comes in chapters And I think Ray and I met at the right time The couple were married in June last year in Lowe Memorial Presbyterian church at Finaghy in Belfast where a very special guest said a prayer for them That man was Roy Miller the plastic surgeon who literally reshaped Melanies young life rebuilding her face and hands Mr Miller who had also helped victims of the IRAs La Mon bombing in carried out countless procedures on Melanie when she was growing up But they met by chance again in Holywood after Melanie moved there and joined a church where Mr Miller and his wife Rosemary worshipped A close friendship developed and even though Melanie moved to another church in Belfast the relationship with the Millers has endured Melanie is now an administrator of the church where she and Ray wed Her son Will walked her up the aisle along with her father William as her other son Leo sang The Star of the County Down On lockdown Melanie has been working from home and schooling her sons She said Its nice to have had more time with the boys but it was frustrating for weeks that we couldnt get down to Fermanagh to see our family there Melanie has also been helping to stream church services as well as organising zoom gatherings and prayer meetings But are any christenings likely in the future for Melanie and Ray No she replied People are always asking me that But we have four children between us we are perfectly happy And something else that has also enhanced Melanies life is her hair She lost most of it in the fire and has relied on wearing wigs but now a foundation set up by TV presenter and model Katie Piper who was the victim of an acid attack is helping Melanie who said They were able to source and fund a hair replacement system which is more like a semipermanent solution It is attached in a different way so that you dont have to take it on and off all the time Its been lifechanging for me As for the future Melanie hasnt ruled out furthering her studies She said It was so frustrating that they came to a halt because I was doing so well and enjoying the studying so much Theres now a possibility of me working towards a masters degree in human rights I havent fallen out of love with the law

laying the road to adoption ALF MCCREARY Wörter Juni   National   Independent  Media Northern Ireland In our continuing series we talk to leading figures about their faith In conversation with Rev Peter Lyle is minister of Ballyholme Presbyterian Church He is married to Heather and they have two daughters Kim and Zoe both adopted from Thailand Can you tell us something about yourself QAI am and I was born in Belfast but grew up in Portrush after my family moved there in My parents were Sam who died on April this year and Pat I have one sister Nicola Heather and I were married in I was educated in Portrush Primary School Coleraine Inst Stranmillis College and Union College in Belfast prior to my ordination as a Presbyterian minister I served in First Antrim as assistant minister then as minister in Ringsend and Second Dunboe in Dublin and I have been at Ballyholme since How and when did you come to faith QAI grew up with a Sunday School and Boys Brigade background In my teens I was a nightmare for my teachers and leaders as my interest in faith decreased Yet even as I drifted I still noticed their wellworn Bibles with underlined verses and notes in the margins and wondered What is this that so impacts their lives I now realise that those same teachers and leaders really cared about me They had discovered the wonder of Jesus wanted me to discover it and were asking God to make it happen He did so at Portrush CSSM I know it was His work because I was primarily attracted by the girls who attended especially by a lovely girl called Heather from Ballycastle I found that CSSM presented the Christian faith in a way that I had never considered before it wasnt churchy they spoke my language and as young people they lived what they talked When I wasnt looking for it nor particularly wanting or expecting it God spoke to me about the wonder of Jesus Q Have you ever had a crisis of faith or a gnawing doubt about your faith A Being a Christian does not exempt me from trouble in life I suffered burnout and depression years ago It was a very dark period and truly horrible Id waken up wanting to go to sleep I couldnt hear Gods soundtrack I was broken Questions like How could this happen and why filled my mind which deeply affected my selfworth I was sinking and felt powerless to do anything about it After a year through medical and spiritual help things turned around The Bible says all things are brought together to work for our good I lived this as God rebuilt me in a new way hopeful more accepting of who I am and stronger Have you ever been angry with God and if so why QAI wouldnt say angry It was just that I did not understand Heather and I faced miscarriage and infertility I remember the sparkle in her eyes going out and feeling so useless and powerless to help her It was a deeply distressing time I couldnt understand why my lovely Heather was being put through so much physical and emotional pain Neither could I see that this was laying the road to the adoption of our two girls from Thailand and a whole dazzling new sparkle in Heathers eyes Do you ever get criticised for your faith QAI have been ignored but never criticised for my faith I dont believe anyone likes to be treated unkindly or disrespectfully especially if something is so deeply meaningful to them Are you ever ashamed of your own Church QShame is a strong word I dont always agree with every Adecision or direction taken I would feel shame if we forgot justice ignored mercy thought more of ourselves than God and didnt speak of the wonder of Jesus ARE you afraid to die QA My dad recently died and I was stunned at the strength and peace I experienced as someone close to it Obviously with the parting of ways it really hurt But death didnt scare me Our girls have really helped to normalise our hope in Christ when they ask What do you think Papa is doing now It breathes a strong sense of continuity into what is happening Do you believe in a resurrection QA The Bible says that not even the most creative imagination can visualise what is going to happen Considering what creative imaginations in art and science can come up with thats quite some statement I believe in the resurrection of the body and a new Heaven and Earth I am thankful for the promise that there will be no more death suffering crying or pain What a world that will be Q What do you think about people of other denominations and other faiths AI have always worked with people from all kinds of Church backgrounds both locally and around the world and it has been a deeply enriching experience Q Would you be comfortable in stepping out from your own faith and trying to learn something from other people A Yes I believe we should always be learners We dont learn by simply listening to what we already know Sometimes the best learning and deepening of faith can come from reflecting on different or contrary ideas Are the Churches here fulfilling their mission QA Many Churches are recapturing a sense of mission to care for the poor and to share the message of Jesus and to help believers mature in their faith and serve in the Church In Bangor you would see this in Storehouse North Down support for Christian Aid and Tear Fund street prayer outreach initiatives ministries to local businesses partnerships between Church school and YMCA in providing afterschool clubs involvement in schools and community projects and discipleship groups Q Why are so many people turning their backs on organised religion A There are many possible reasons attenders who never believed in the first place and are attending no longer and choreography that is appearing detached or dated However I dont think people are turning away from God or faith The coronavirus pandemic has seen a surge in Google searches for faithrelated subjects like prayer The growth of new expressions of Church is significant There is a restlessness in humanity and a yearning for something more There are many more options in which to go searching today but I believe what Augustine said that our hearts are restless until they find their rest in God Q Has religion helped or hindered the people of Northern Ireland A In at a time when others were banned from doing so my fatherinlaw met with representatives from both sides of the Troubles encouraging them towards peaceful dialogue He did so as a Christian I believe Northern Ireland benefited from such bold steps What is your favourite pastime book and music QAI love travelling particularly in East Asia something reflected in our home with our Thai daughters On sabbatical last year I visited Hong Kong Japan Thailand Cambodia and Singapore It was wonderful My musical choice is at the heavier end of rock for its energy and emotion The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe by CS Lewis is a book that has travelled through my life revealing new layers of meaning as I age Where do you feel closest to God QA The kind of place where God changes lives last year in Cambodia witnessing lives rescued from exploitation and given the dignity of being loved retrained in new skills given support to find employment a new life and the opportunity to

586,../data/sec_IRL/Belfast Telegraph/Factiva-20230807-170, Religious belief kept many people sane during the Troubles sadly we tended to preach our own nationalist or loyalist version of the Gospel Alf McCreary Wörter Juli   National   Independent  Media Northern Ireland In our continuing series we talk to leading figures about their faith Canon Jimmy McPhillips is the parish priest in Lisnaskea and Aghalurcher He recently made headlines by jokingly playing a recording of The Sash at the end of a livestreamed Mass in his church Can you tell us something about your background QAI was born in Newtownbutler Co Fermanagh on June and my parents were Tommy and Peggy My mother is still alive and well at My father was the local insurance agent I have four brothers Ritchie Eamonn Tony and Michael and my sister Cora all living locally I also have two nephews seven nieces three grandnieces and four grandnephews My father died in when five out of six of us were still in primary and secondary school Dad was also a county councillor and rural district councillor in Lisnaskea My late granduncle was John Carron the MP for Fermanagh my older brother Ritchie was a member of the Northern Ireland Assembly my brother Tony was a Fermanagh district councillor and my nephew Garbhan is presently a member of the Fermanagh and Omagh District Council So public service has been engrained in my life for many years What about your education and early career QAI went to St Marys Primary School in Newtownbutler and my secondary education was in thethen St Comghalls Secondary School in Lisnaskea now St Kevins I started my own retail business in Newtownbutler after completing my secondary education and worked at that for six years before entering St Patricks Seminary in Thurles Co Tipperary to begin studies for the priesthood I was ordained on June for the Diocese of Clogher and I have served in Monaghan town Carrickmacross Killanny Derrygonnelly and now as parish priest in Lisnaskea and the Parish of Aghalurcher How and when did you come to faith QAI was brought up in a very traditional Catholic home We were regular church attenders and family prayer and the practice of the sacraments was a big part of our lives While I was a cradle Catholic my faith was immersed within my early years but it was during my late secondary school period that the spark of a vocation was lit However I took until the age of before I pursued that Faith in Christ is part of who I am each day of my life I am very conscious of the instrument I am for Christ and so all that I do and say is driven by that call that awareness I am constantly thanking Him for my vocation and for providing me with all that I need to minister as a priest Q Have you ever had a crisis of faith or a gnawing doubt about your faith A During my early years of studying to be a priest I did go through a dark period of doubt and my simple faith was being challenged greatly Nevertheless I got through that dark night of the soul through simply surrendering my days and weeks and months into Gods hands Thankfully I have never gone through a crisis of faith ever since Have you ever been angry with God And if so why QAI wouldnt say angry but I have questioned God when I am in the midst of tragedy Again when I surrender to His will I regain my faith and trust in Him again Are you able to live with criticism of your faith QAI only experience criticism when I speak to the media and much of it although not all of it is generally unfair because most of the attackers dont know me They have a chip on their shoulders about the Church or priests and that criticism can damage the morale I dont need to expose myself to those attacks so I have recently withdrawn from speaking to the media despite giving this interview Q Are you ever ashamed of your own Church or denomination A There have been times when I was certainly ashamed of my Church as an institution and in particular its failure to address the whole issue of child sexual abuse within the Church I think our leadership failed us all greatly but in particular the survivors victims of abuse Are you afraid to die QOr can you look beyond death AI have absolutely no fear of death having been by the side of so many in my ministry My faith assures me that I will meet my God face to face again and I look forward to that great day but I do wish to hang around in this life for a little longer ARE you afraid of hell QA My God is a God of love so that image doesnt sit easily with me I do feel that hell is that great absence of God so to be without God is hell Q Do you believe in a resurrection And if so what will it be like A Yes I believe that as Jesus rose from the dead we too will rise some day I dont think we will come back as we left for the resurrected body will be so perfect from having been so close to God Q What about people of other denominations and other faiths AI am always very conscious that I am an accident of birth I could have been born a Protestant a Muslim a Jew so out of that awareness and having been brought up by two good Christian parents I was given and still have great respect and admiration for all other beliefs I am very aware of all that unites us rather than what divides us so I have always been very comfortable working with all the other Christian Churches Q Would you be comfortable in trying to learn something from other people AI am always open to learn from other faiths and to bring those aspects into my own faith life However I am at home in my own faith after nearly years of it and without demeaning any other faith I have all I need within the Catholic Church to sustain a faith life Q Do you think that the Churches here are fulfilling their mission I would have to say a big no AOur Troubles certainly didnt help in furthering that mission of Christ there is still so much hurt from our troubled past so much distrust and raw hate towards each other in this part of our world Sadly we tended to preach our own nationalistloyalist version of the Gospel during our troubled period and so there is much much more to be done to ensure that Christs voice is heard above our own partisan opinions Q Why are so many people turning their backs on organised religion A We have failed miserably to preach and live by the ways of Jesus Christ and many of our people and in particular our youth have seen through this hypocrisy While spirituality that sense of a God is innate to the Irish our institutional religious practice doesnt adequately nourish that soul anymore Maybe after this pandemic when people have had more time to think about the sacredness of their own lives and where they are going after this one and because so many are now joining us online maybe the new virtual Church might attract more people and better again help to reform it into what Christ really wanted for it Q Has religion helped or hindered the people of Northern Ireland A That question causes me to sigh greatly Religious belief kept many of our people across the divide sane during the Troubles However I also feel that organised religion kept us in our own ghettoes and we stayed there loyally and blindly without any great respect for those in the other community In general I would sadly have to admit that the different religious denominations hindered more than helped in the north Q What is your favourite film book and music and why A My favourite film is The Mission the movie with Robert De Niro Jeremy Irons and our own Liam Neeson I love all music from classical to rock to traditional and worship music Unfortunately I dont take the time to read books but I am reading Chest Pain by Michael Harding at the moment I enjoy his fun look on life Where do you feel closest to God QA In my prayer room without the phone and any other distractions But I have recently taken up the bike and I am constantly in awe at Gods creation and the beauty of life Q What inscription would you like on your gravestone if any Did His Best Now Rest In Peace AFinally have you any major regrets QA To be honest none And if I was to be given the opportunity to live this life again I would live it just as I did this time

595,../data/sec_IRL/Belfast Telegraph/Factiva-20230807-1705(1, Why I feel like a stranger in my own city AlfMcCreary Wörter Juli   National   Independent  Media Northern Ireland His first trip into Belfast in three months left Alf McCreary shocked at its strange emptiness and nostalgic for the bustling streets and busy venues before the pandemic Afew days ago I went into the centre of Belfast because of an important business meeting and within minutes I felt like a stranger in my own city where I have worked and lived for over years One of my favourite parts of Belfast is around our magnificent City Hall and the spacious Donegall Square leading on to Bedford Street as far as the traffic lights at the BBC In this relatively small area I have often worked and been entertained or entertained myself for most of my adult life One of the architectural jewels of this area is the Ulster Hall where I have attended very many concerts ranging from those by our excellent Ulster Orchestra right through to Belfast Music Schools annual concerts including those where my granddaughter Cara has appeared on stage On one occasion long ago I queued at the Ulster Hall box office for a ticket to a classical concert featuring the music of Tchaikovsky In front of me were two clothcapped Ulstermen who were talking loudly and I marvelled at the drawing power of Tchaikovsky However just as we reached the box office counter one of the Ulstermen in dunchers said loudly to his mate Jimmy we are in the wrong place The wrestling is on at the Kings Hall the night not the Ulster Hall The Ulster Hall has also staged wrestling and boxing in its long history and in classical music terms it is reckoned by nearly all the eminent visiting conductors and soloists I have interviewed as having some of the best acoustics of any concert hall in Europe The Ulster Hall has staged many important political rallies and it has long been at the centre of much of our local history including that fateful day in when the antiHome Rule audience filled it and then marched to the City Hall where many of them signed the Ulster Covenant in their own blood Not far away is the stately Presbyterian Church House headquarters in Fisherwick Place where I have reported many stories in my role as religion correspondent for this newspaper for nearly two decades Across the road stands the Europa Hotel world famous for surviving so many bombings including one of the first that I reported for this newspaper and later for the Manchester Guardian So this relatively small area of Belfast has always been close to my heart and when I went there recently I subconsciously expected to be returning to a little bit of my spiritual and worldly home after such a long absence due to the lockdown I even expected to have to drive around the block a couple of times to find a parking space in one of the normally most trafficcongested parts of the city The reality was rather different I drove past the Ulster Hall and found one of several empty places in the normally crowded parking space beside the BBC building and that was a real bonus I had about a halfhour free before my business appointment and I had intended to indulge myself with a coffee in one of the nearby caferestaurants while reading my pristine copies of The Times and the  Sadly the newspaper shop on the block was the only place that seemed to be open and I set off to walk past the closed and sadly gloomy Ulster Hall in search of my obligatory morning coffee My journey took me round to Great Victoria Street just beside the Europa where there is normally a very busy coffee shop just beside the entrance to the bus and railway station To my relief the coffee shop was open but apart from one other person who came rather too close to me to maintain social distancing I was the only other coffee addict in the place After being served by a charming young woman wearing blue gloves I sat outside in the rare Belfast sunshine to watch the world go by Unfortunately that was a dream rather than a reality as it seemed that very little of the world was actually going by The buses were largely empty the other traffic was light and the few people who passed me either way were much younger than me There hardly seemed a person over in sight So I sat there nursing my coffee and wondering to myself if this was the Belfast I had known for so long and had come to love with all its frustrations and faults Or on the contrary was it a strangely halfempty and halfclosed city still trying to come to terms with the complexities of easing itself out of the long lockdown I was sitting at a cafe in Great Victoria Street looking up and down what used to be called the Golden Mile the link between the newly refurbished Grand Opera House and Queens University the home of what was the Queens Festival which every November brought light into the darkness of the Troubles and helped the rejuvenation of a cultural life in Belfast that was virtually dying at the time Reflecting on my memories of the Golden Mile at its best I really did feel a little strange in a place which had become part of my DNA However I was also aware that Belfast and its people are resilient We have survived more than years of bombs and bullets and we will survive this pandemic My recent experience of going into Belfast for the first time in over three months also made me realise that coming out of this lockdown may be more complicated than many of us think For a long time thousands of us have been locked away in our own bubble watching the outside world on television or reading about it in our newspapers There is also the feeling that because the hotels restaurants and pubs have been allowed to reopen the pace of life is back to normal The reality is that a good number of these are not yet open and instead of a half normal and partly bustling city which I naively expected to find there is still a sense of strange emptiness in some familiar places which will only disappear when normality returns however long that may take Understandably many people are still frightened and anxious about the pandemic and they are hesitant about returning to their own familiar haunts throughout Belfast Without doubt the same applies to other parts of this province and island I know also that our traders and shopowners and other institutions are showing courage in reopening and we must do all we can to help them by going out and spending Nevertheless employers and business experts are holding their breath about the possible dire economic consequences of the lockdown but there is also the important social challenge of how all of us individually and collectively will come to terms with trying to live with the new normal which is still not at all normal in so many respects No doubt I will continue to stay in love with my version of Belfast as I too play my part with everyone else in trying to come back to normality but I have realised the hard way that one of the hitherto hidden prices to pay for the long pandemic lockdown is to feel however fleetingly a stranger in my own city But I also know that better days undoubtedly lie ahead for all of us

600,../data/sec_IRL/Belfast Telegraph/Factiva-20230807-1705(1, In our continuing series we talk to leading figures about their faith RevPeterHilton Wörter August   National   Independent  Media Northern Ireland Before our two girls came along we had two miscarriages The overriding emotion was one of anger At that time I found that having it out with God in prayer was a kind of therapy In conversation with Rev Peter Hilton is curate at St Marks Church of Ireland parish Newtownards He and his wife Gemma have two children Lydia and Eva Can you tell us something about your background QAIm and I grew up in Belfast during the end of the Troubles and the beginning of peace Ive an older sister Wendy and a younger brother David Despite being children born in the early my parents Susan and Brian a former teacher maintain that the Peter Pan film did not inspire their choice of names Ive been married to Gemma for years I was educated at Gilnahirk Primary School Wellington College and Queens University Belfast with the theology course in Union College I studied parttime for five years How did you come to faith QAI have in some shape or form always worked for the Church I was in the final year of school when I was converted to Christianity and this shaped my degree choice Instead of going down the planned law route I read English literature and theology and until I was ordained last year I worked in Church youth work and Church mission work spending much of my working life with the Leprosy Mission How and when did you come to faith QA In my teenage years I was a devout atheist I had an extensive list of questions and accusations that I regularly put to Christians about the conduct of God and the Church throughout history My parents are Christians and they were very patient and gracious with me as were many of my Christian school friends Everything changed one evening when I was alone reading a book I can only describe the experience in this way the room was filled with a powerful wonderful spiritual presence I knew from that moment on that despite all my best arguments God was real Not long after that a friend led me in prayer to commit my life to following Jesus From that moment of meeting God my whole life began to change slowly but surely My career path changed and my purpose in life changed I spent my time seeking to help others to find God and to find the amazing sense of peace and direction which in my experience only God can give Q Have you ever had a crisis of faith or a gnawing doubt about your faith AI got my crisis of faith out of my system before I found my faith asking all the hard questions then However I would say that at times of loss Ive found myself facing dark times of doubting I recall feeling very distant from God and lost in my faith when before our two girls came along we had two miscarriages The overriding emotion was one of anger At that time I found that having it out with God in prayer was a kind of therapy Q Do you ever get criticised for your faith And are you able to live with that criticism A Wearing a clerical collar has been an interesting experience it evokes a response from strangers Often people are very kind but sometimes they have a go at you I dont mind that it keeps you grounded Q Are you ever ashamed of your own Church or denomination A Honestly no When the Church makes a mistake it is willing to put its hands up and try again Are you afraid to die QOr can you look beyond death AIm not afraid at the thought of death but I am depressed by the prospect The process of dying is never pretty and often debilitating I look at what is beyond death and Im genuinely excited To be in the presence of God to experience that amazing power and love that I have in a small way experienced on a grand scale is a wonderful thought ARE you afraid of hell QAI hope that by the grace of God and love of Jesus I can avoid it but yes it does scare me I studied the Book of Revelation in some detail during my ministry training and I discovered that the fiery wrath of God is linked inextricably to the need to bring justice to those situations in the world were evil acts are unrepentantly committed on innocent people For me that helps to put into some context the reason for hellfire and punishment for those who escape justice in this world Q Do you believe in a resurrection And if so what will it be like A Yes From my reading of Corinthians we will receive new bodies that will not decay or age and we will be in Gods presence forever Well not be floating about in the clouds as our spiritselves eternal life will be a very real grounded and interesting state Q What do you think about people of other denominations and other faiths AI recognise that we are all different so it is inevitable that there will be different expressions of Christian faith However I think it is important that Christians from all denominations work together pray together care for and look after one another Conflict and fallout among the Church goes completely against what Jesus tells us to do to love our neighbour as our self That command Jesus gives to love others extends to how Christians interact with people from other faiths and should shape our language and actions towards them Q Would you be comfortable in stepping out from your own faith A Probably not But that is not to say I would not give it a try Listening to other people and learning from their experience may not be comfortable but Id argue that you grow and learn more in times of discomfort Q Do you think that the Churches here are fulfilling their mission A In normal times I might have more hesitation answering this question but over this time of pandemic from what Ive seen and heard Id say yes the Church is fulfilling its mission to tell people about Jesus and to share His love Churches have learnt how to communicate online in ways that theyd never done before and that has helped them to reach out into homes and lives previously unreached by the Good  Theyve also been very active in reaching out in love to the community in inventive practical ways at a time of need and isolation Q Why are so many people turning their backs on organised religion A When Sunday School was first set up it was to educate people not just about faith but also in writing maths and other subjects Today school provides that function Many hospitals were once funded and run by organised religion Today healthcare is a state enterprise Years ago the local church was a community hub Today communities are much less constrained by geographical locations The Church has been squeezed out from the centre to the margins of life and so peoples links with the Church have increasingly weakened The challenge for the Church today is to find ways to reconnect with people in daytoday life Q Has religion helped or hindered the people of Northern Ireland A As I grew up and saw the religious divisions intertwine with the Troubles I thought that religion was a hypocritical hindrance to the people of Northern Ireland Time has tempered this view for a couple of reasons Firstly it was those religious figures who shouted the loudest that I was hearing back then Second Ive discovered over the years many amazing peacemakers and community champions who are driven by their religious zeal to carry out their quiet transformative works Their work has undoubtedly helped bring healing to broken and divided communities Q What is your favourite film book and music and why A The film would be The Bourne Trilogy

608,../data/sec_IRL/Belfast Telegraph/Factiva-20230807-1705(1,Features I just adore watching programmes about the royals Barry Egan Wörter September   National   Independent  Media Northern Ireland Singer Daniel ODonnell tells Barry Egan about getting through lockdown how his father died when he was just six and visiting relatives in Londonderry during the Troubles Julia and Francis ODonnells grave is only a mile or two from where their son Daniel lives in Donegal The singer visits them at St Marys cemetery in Belcruit as often as he can Daniel believes death is the start of a new journey Sometimes the many years between his parents starting their respective new journeys has caused Daniel some amusing graveside confusion Julia died in at Francis in when he was and Daniel barely six I say Well Mam hello there I forget that my father is there too He is there such a long time Sometimes I have to say We never mention you at all Daniel doesnt leave flowers on the grave because his mother wasnt a great woman for flowers He has no memory of what his father was like I was told that he was a very quiet man I know he liked to sing songs too says Daniel who can recall singing The Boys of the County Armagh by Bridie Gallagher when he was six or seven My father was a good singer His fathers family all sang All his sisters My aunt Mary And my mothers side sang too Daniels mother was from Owey Island off the coast of Donegal His father was from Burtonport All his family and my mothers family were good singers Does Daniel sing in the shower or the bath at home Neither I very rarely sing around the house We talk about the pandemic a religious man does Daniel ever ask why God allowed to take so many lives I cant answer that I cant think that way Hopefully things will get better I dont try to make sense of everything that has happened Is that the voice of a sixyearold boy who couldnt make sense of suddenly losing his dad I dont remember trying to make sense of that either I dont know what has me the way I am I dont know what happened in my life that has me the way I am I cant credit or blame I have no memories of my father Daniel never became a father himself He married Majella in I have nieces and nephews I have Siobhan and Michael Majellas grownup children who came into my life and we have two grandchildren So I feel I have been very fortunate to have all that in my life Did he and Majella try to have a baby We didnt not try If you know what I mean I suppose at the very beginning we were both in our so the chances were that we wouldnt have a child And Majella was a couple of years older than me So it just never happened You have to be realistic when you get older He is releasing a new studio album Daniel on October with tracks of new recordings including Remember Me a duet with Majella and a cover of Ed Sheerans Perfect So our national treasure is somewhat busy at the moment in contrast to the start of the outbreak back in March Och during the lockdown nobody visited the house he says of the home that architect Dermot Bannon transformed in on RTEs Room To Improve On an odd occasion the doorbell rang Youd be nearly jumping out of your skin to see who was coming Or why they were coming Why Is the driveway that long Its not too long no Is their house like Southfork Ranch in Dallas No not quite Southfork Daniel laughs adding that he and Majella have sufficient space that during lockdown they were able to go out for walks and meet very few people if any at all Also the weather was so good from March to June that the couple were outside nearly all the time They did bits and pieces in the garden It was lovely to watch the flowers and wild flowers grow over that period Indoors Majella did a bit of painting She does nice stuff She is very into acrylic art She only started doing it in recent times over the past four or five years but she has a great flair for it Daniel says proudly He hadnt been at home for that length of time for years Since school he says If it werent for the terrible circumstances I would say it was a fantastic period Underlying it of course was all the uncertainty And every day I was watching the news and seeing people dying and more people being ill So from that point of view it wasnt a pleasant experience but the actual thing of being at home with Majella all the time was lovely He didnt spend all that time reflecting Och I am not a person who looks back who reminisces I mean I remember everything and I am grateful for things But there is no point in looking back because you can do nothing about what is past And you cant do much about whats coming either You can just do what youre doing today So make the best of that Daniel gives an insight into the dynamic between himself and Majella I dont need to be entertained all the time I dont need to have something to do I can be very calm and just sit This will prompt Majella he says to ask him What are you thinking about To which Daniel will invariably reply Im not really thinking about anything I havent got a racing mind he explains Majellas mind is always thinking on something So were quite different in that respect Was the lockdown difficult for Majella who in the past has suffered with depression No She did well She was fine Majella was kept busy throughout because her mother Marion was living nearby in Dungloe They were making sure she was all right bringing stuff and leaving stuff for her mother It was another mother the Queen Mum to say nothing of the Queen herself that Majella and Daniel loved watching on The Crown on Netflix at the start of the pandemic I adore watching programmes about the royals I have to say Before the pandemic Daniel spent a lot of time on tour in America How does he feel about the Black Lives Matter movement which mushroomed in response to the murder by a white police officer of an unarmed black man in Minneapolis It is very upsetting that we cannot live together says Daniel All I know is that we shouldnt have this unrest because Im white and youre black Or Im a Catholic and youre a Protestant or youre a Muslim That should not be The world is for all of us irrespective of whether were black or white yellow or whether we believe this that or the other There is room in it for all of us We should respect one another Whether I believe this and you believe that we should have the common sense to respect one anothers beliefs There shouldnt be unrest in the world But there is Its hard to figure out but I suppose where there are humans there will be failings The basis of all religions is treat others as you would like to be treated yourself If we respect one another we should not have these troubles but thats not how it is sadly Daniel wouldnt be a politician he says for all the tea in China He always voted for Fianna Fails Pat the Cope Gallagher because he was from Dungloe a local man He lost his seat in the last election I dont know who I will vote for now My mother would have been a big Neil Blaney supporter He was a very good man He was a good politician He was very good for Donegal Daniel grew up well aware of the Troubles but he doesnt have a memory of how it affected me positively or negatively We used to go to relations in Derry and for holidays We had a lot of friends in the North We were very aware of the North of course Was he ever frightened to go to Derry as a kid No but I was always wary of going over the border and being checked I was always glad when we went through the army checkpoint I would hate to see a border again When was the last time he cried Just recently Someone close to me died It is a sad time Has Daniel found himself praying more during the pandemic You pray as much as you can and you feel for people and offer up a prayer for different things Praying doesnt necessarily give him peace because he says Im not peaceful Im not troubled personally but Im concerned for the future for people I hope once this is controlled and eradicated we can get back to living Daniel watches Mass on the webcam It was great solace and focus for people Everyone was praying for the one thing that people would get through this It was a uniting thing for a lot of communities

Primate of AllIreland Robin Eames who is now a crossbench life peer They have two sons Niall and Michael two daughtersinlaw and seven grandchildren Q Can you tell us something about your background AI was born in Dublin and grew up in Belfast My father Captain Ward Daly was killed in action in the North African campaign in during the Second World War I was only six weeks old so my mother Olive had the sole responsibility for my upbringing She was an absolutely wonderful mother and I enjoyed a very happy childhood She was matron of the Forster Green Hospital in Belfast and I learned from her the standards of commitment and responsibility to others She had a great and sustaining faith and I always knew the Christian faith and in particular the Anglican Church to be an integral part of our lives QWhat about your education AI loved my school Ashleigh House which gave me a great many opportunities and friendships some of which I still enjoy today I read law at Queens University Belfast and graduated with a LLB degree and later with a MPhil in medical law and ethics With Robin I have been part of the life and family of the Church of Ireland in different places here and around the world Much of Robins ministry has been during times of violence unrest and disturbance with much suffering for many people and untold challenges for Church and community That was so often the backcloth to our family life Robin and I have two sons Niall and Michael both orthopaedic surgeons two daughtersinlaw and seven grandchildren We are so very grateful for each one of them Q Have you ever been angry with God A No never I must have disappointed God many times I have been given so many opportunities and my response has been so poor One of my great privileges of life in the Church has been an acceptance by friends and strangers around the world particularly during my six years as world president of the Mothers Union which reaches out to millions of families around the world Q Have you ever been ashamed of your Church or denomination ANo Rather I have watched so many clergy try to respond to the challenges facing them and often wondered at their faithfulness week by week in their parishes particularly during days of deep division and much destruction in our community In different parts of the world I have worshipped with people living an impoverished existence in camps for displaced persons and refugees and I have been humbled by their faith I have friends in many denominations and none I believe that the voice of the Christian faith must be heard in our world today and that is the responsibility of all who profess our faith and that over and over again that voice is louder and clearer when we are united Q Do you believe in a resurrection A For most of my life Sunday by Sunday I have said the Creed What I believe was taught in Sunday School many years ago and I believe in God the Father the Son and Holy Spirit and in the resurrection and in life everlasting Q Are the Churches fulfilling their mission AI know that at a personal level religion and faith have upheld countless people in all kinds of difficulties and great sorrow At a community level I think that here we often let our religion and political viewpoint interweave to the benefit of neither Q Why are so many people turning their backs on organised religion A Our whole way of life has been changed so much during this century with two World Wars for example and at present the effects of the pandemic which we are experiencing The Churches have been challenged to find ways to express ministry and to present ways of worship I think that this challenge will still be here for some time to come but the Churches have adapted and are learning once again how to present the unchanging presence of God in a rapidly changed and changing world I believe strongly that it is important to speak about the things of the Church at this time Q What inscription would you like on your tombstone if any AI dont need to answer this question it belongs to my family Q What is your favourite film book and piece of music AI like films that reflect a true story or make me laugh I enjoyed the film Invictus because it told an amazing story and how thinking out of the box can provide a solution in an unexpected way I like to read biographies especially when they tell the story of the environment or the times the person lived in and how their lives were shaped by events I enjoyed the biography of Clementine Churchill I love Handels Messiah particularly the Hallelujah Chorus It is so moving when people of all faiths and none are touched by it and the whole audience stands in response Q Where do you feel closest to God AI feel close to God everywhere Q Finally have you any major regrets AI dont have any regrets about the major things in my life I have been surrounded by wonderful people and I have had amazing experiences I do regret that I did not fully appreciate the opportunities to show kindness to learn more and to have fun I regret all the times I have failed to be punctual and have kept family and friends waiting but thats a workinprogress

something about your background AI am just turned years old and I was born in Portadown to a farmer father Ivan and my nursing student mother Jenny Unfortunately a car crash killed my father before I was oneyearold and we moved to be near my maternal grandmother Eileen in Newry My mother married Paul Rooney when I was a teenager and I had a younger brother James Tragically he was killed five years ago while at university It has been a very difficult time for our family Q What about your education and early career AI attended school in Newry and studied dentistry at Queens University Belfast I worked for several years in the south of England before traveling to Guatemala as a missionary On returning I became a senior house officer in oral surgery in Belfast while applying for training for the ministry During my earlier years I was afforded the privilege of playing hockey for Ulster Ireland and various clubs I played in an attacking role for Ireland and was awarded caps between and Some eight years ago I completed my ministerial training and became minister of Windsor Presbyterian Church on the Lisburn Road in Belfast Q How and when did you come to faith A My grandmother in her early became a Christian through a Brethren Hall and her life was transformed My mother also found faith strangely around the time of my fathers death and both of their influences of prayer and example during those difficult years has always endured I can still feel the prayers of my grandmother The image of her on her knees beside her bed praying is so comforting I came to faith at an early age and have always been drawn to Bible reading and prayer This early faith really found wings though on going up to university in the mid I became very unsettled and stale in faith However on attending an Alpha course at Fisherwick Presbyterian Church and coming under the influence of Rev Derek McKelvey a whole new experience of God opened up I became aware for the first time about the Holy Spirit and this married to my early evangelical background brought my faith to life the two can be an explosive pair This was a massive turning point and my faith had joy and energy Q Have you ever had a crisis or a gnawing doubt about your faith A Most people must struggle from time to time with doubt I constantly struggle with the application of faith but have rarely doubted Gods existence the world is too complex and intriguing to look away from God Q Have you ever been angry with God And if so why AI think God can cope with our honest anger even when it is directed at Him Q Are you ever ashamed of your own Church or denomination AThe Presbyterian Church is far from perfect I dont think there are any doubts about the mistakes that we have made I try to be part of the discussion going forward Jesus is perfect but His Church is not And neither am I Q Are you afraid to die Or can you look beyond death AI dont fear death but that is easy to say when you are fit and healthy My Masters dissertation was on the resurrection which is central to our faith and hope I believe that there will be a continuation to what we know now the good will remain and the pain and loss will go Q What do you think about people of other denominations and other faiths AI am very grateful to the generosity of other Churches especially with the relief efforts for destitute people and families during the current crisis We have been supporting weekly in excess of families and this couldnt have happened without cooperation and partnership We have people from very diverse backgrounds worshipping at Windsor and it has been incredible to learn from each of their cultures and experiences I am especially thankful to the large number of Iranians who worship with us Q Are the Churches here fulfilling their mission A With nominal attendance in churches slipping away we are seeing Churches once again standing with those who have no one to speak for them I attend meetings dealing with destitution and asylum needs and invariably it is the Churches that are making the difference in peoples lives Q Why are so many people turning their backs on organised religion A Recently the story of the Church in Europe has been one of decay and losing numbers but with our global perspective we can see the renewal process happening in many parts of the world including unusual places like Iran We are seeing the

Ireland Derry Girls star Tommy Tiernan talks to Hilary A White about the rollercoaster that has been lockdown and how he surprises himself with some of the questions he asks on his chat show QUARE is the word Tommy Tiernan hits on Hes describing lockdown and after a moment or two of thought this very Tiernanish word will do nicely thank you He spells it out down the phone chuckling at its euphemistic qualities Yeah a quare few months he says I really enjoyed the start of it I was glad to come off the road in March I started cooking I cleaned the house a few times the weather was beautiful But Ive noticed that its gone through waves While many parents will empathise with the fatherofsix it is something of a change for Tiernan There was a time when this brightest of touring standup stars couldnt wait to get home and be reunited with his children But comedy above all other art forms feeds off audience interaction Im noticing that theres a necessary vitamin that has been sucked out of my body he agrees And its the one I get when I meet people and encounter crowds and drive places It feels like all our confidence has been taken away Were mourning the loss of something we cant name yet With time on his hands during that first lockdown Tiernan was able to think about what he had really been enjoying most in terms of work and how he could recreate it in the world of Two things stood out in his mind The first was the process of acting rehearsals something he has experienced in the hit TV comedy Derry Girls and Ian Fitzgibbons crime saga Dark Lies the Island The other was the show he copresented on iRadio and RTE with Hector O hEochagain and Laurita Blewitt a format the trio have now transferred to the podcast arena Long before pandemics forced him down the back garden Tiernan was already entering into an interesting new chapter in his career He was coming to feel that his biggest calling card was not necessarily his soldout theatre runs the comedy awards the DVDs and so on but his new guise as a chat show host The Tommy Tiernan Show is about to start filming its fifth season after firmly establishing itself as an unlikely RTE knockout that has earned pride of place in the primetime listings The format surprise guests of varying starwattage interviewed without preparation has proved a hit with viewers and critics alike A selection of the most memorable and diverse interviews has been compiled in transcript layout as Winging It The book Tiernan says has personal currency for him as a link to these intense but fleeting experiences My son is in a punk band and they were talking about how one of the things bands today envy of bands in the past is vinyl An LP you can show people whereas with you cant I feel the same about the show Tiernan toggles back from gas craic to contemplative as he so often can When Im in the moment the question I am asking really is the only one that comes into my mind The memory of the interview happening is a very separate thing from reading the book Theres no real connection My memories of it are so theres nothing to grab on to Theyre like dreams A dream isnt as real as the table Im sitting beside I have more of a relationship with the table therefore than I do with the interviews Thats why its wonderful to hold them tangibly in book form Whereas the US has a tradition of giving chat shows to comedians he explains they have always tended towards lightness Here meanwhile chat shows were the preserve of talented broadcasters who would maintain a semblance of helmsmanship and responsibility during questioning Because the interview has no map you basically have to celebrate whatever is happening at that particular time and trust your instinct entirely I remember the time we had Dublin imam and respected scholar Shaykh Umar alQadri on the show I asked him to sing and he said hed be delighted to and I said Youre not going to blow up now afterwards are you There was a gasp from the audience but he started laughing Those ingredients lead to wonderful moments Mostly however Tiernans onthefly interview style makes use of trust to draw out moments of incredible candidness from celebrities whom we perhaps thought we had the measure of Bob Geldof describing being overcome with grief in his car Paul McGrath conceding his long battle with alcohol Brendan OCarroll hitting rock bottom He experiences preshow nerves with this gig that dont occur when he is in standup mode he says plainly and he has come to accept that this might just be the price he has to pay for the gold being unearthed Id spend too much time trying to get the interview right Tiernan laughs overthinking it and trying to be too clever with the guest or overly concerned about them having a good time Say John Banville came on and I had a week to prepare I know what would happen Id say to myself Great Ive a week now Ill read a few of his books But I wouldnt and then the day of the interview Id be going F I should have read some of his books So all of that pressure is taken away Tiernan catches a beam of realisation God knows he could be the first guest in the new series Winging It TwentyOne

COVER STORY Best known for his role as Baldrick in the Blackadder television series the actor and documentary maker tells Linda Stewart why it is important that we cherish our past and preserve our historic treasures The church brought back from the dead Its only too easy to be able to picture a youthful Sir Tony Robinson playing the Artful Dodger Now hes been acting for an incredible years having cut his teeth at the age of in the original stage version of Oliver But he still projects that impish yet wry quality that won the appreciation of TV audiences as Baldrick in Blackadder In the years since he has built on a fascination with all things historical to become the face of Time Team The Worst Jobs in History and numerous other documentaries Now faced with one of the biggest historical events that any of us will ever experience he has teamed up with The National Lottery to cheerlead for the heritage champions who have quietly battled to keep our national treasures in shape through a devastating pandemic This week he unveiled an historic takeover of Stonehenge with a cunning plan to illuminate the sarsen stones with images of the unsung heritage champions from across the UK including Northern Irelands own William Colvin who has worked tirelessly to rescue a deconsecrated church in Cushendun and convert it into an arts centre Sir Tony admits hes always loved history since listening to stories from his parents Leslie and Phyllis during his childhood in the East End of London Ive always thought how do you know who you are unless you know where you come from he says He credits his father with inspiring that passion saying he is thankful for the awareness he was given of the times his father lived through and his grandparents before that He would have talked about life in the East End and life in the north east of Scotland during the war serving with the RAF he says But he admits that as a child performance was an even greater passion I was always singing dancing and reciting poetry I was an extroverted kid doing a lot of performance and reading voraciously he says I always say nowadays to kids read the label on the pickle jar read the gas bill read the newspapers and read everything on the internet that youre allowed to read Read wonderful books and read trashy books the sheer act of reading will open your mind and develop your critical faculties His early enthusiasm for performance won him an iconic stage role at an early age I started acting at the age of in the original stage version of Oliver So Ive been in the business for years I started off as one of the boys in the workhouse and Fagins gang and then I became the understudy for the Artful Dodger and I played the Artful Dodger on lots of occasions The young Tony attended the Central School of Speech and Drama and appeared in a number of West End shows film and television followed by four years in repertory theatre founding the Avon Touring Company and performing with the Royal Shakespeare Company But it wasnt until much later that he won his big break securing the role of Baldrick the dimwitted turniploving sidekick to Rowan Atkinsons Blackadder I was when I got my big break in Blackadder which was massive he says Years after it was made the historical sitcom is still winning over audiences with its irreverent depiction of authority down the centuries while also breaking hearts with an unexpectedly poignant finale as the main characters went over the top in the First World War trenches While Blackadder only ran to four series aired on the BBC between to Sir Tony will always be firmly associated with the obsequious Baldrick Besides Rowan Atkinson he was the only actor to appear in every episode in all four series of Blackadder While some actors may grow weary of being linked to a particular role Sir Tony fully appreciates the doors that Baldrick opened to him in the years after Blackadder He insists he isnt haunted by the spectre of Baldrick No Im not I can see how people can be but he provided me with the ability to open the office door If you have ideas for things the most important thing is to get into the office and pitch things That highprofile role helped him to pitch many of his beloved history documentaries as well as other acting roles and he admits that as a member of the Blackadder ensemble many people assumed hed been to Eton and Oxbridge Ive had a fantastic career in the latter part of my life that I could never have dreamed of having he says But he admits he is proudest of the creative role he had in Maid Marian and her Merry Men the Childrens BBC series which was due to be revived as a stage version until Covid put paid to the plan There are now talks with Netflix about the possibility of a revamp of the surreal show which aired from to and saw him starring as the devious Sheriff of Nottingham Sir Tony relished playing a villain after years as the lovable Baldrick and is proud of how successful the show was It won lots of awards and was number one in the ratings I crafted it myself it came out of my experience of all those bright young men I was working with on Blackadder he says And he admits to the subversive side of the scriptwriting Ive always been of that tradition that believes art is at its best when there is an element of subversion in it whether you talk about stand up comedy or reading James Joyce I read Ulysses during lockdown and its a wellrespected great literary masterpiece and its one of the most subversive pieces of work ever written After Maid Marian there was an improvised stage show Tony Robinsons Cunning Night Out and he narrated the abridged audiobook versions of the Terry Practhetts Discworld series but he was becoming better known for his work as a history presenter In he embarked on the first of episodes of archaeological TV programme Time Team which went on to span years He also branched out into history documentaries such as Fact or Fiction Romans and the hugely successful The Worst Jobs in History as well as a special called Tony Robinsons Titanic Adventure joining director James Cameron on his final dive to the wreck of the Titanic A handful of the Time Team shows took place in Northern Ireland but he hasnt been in Ireland as much as he would have liked Ive pitched so many ideas for shows in the north and the south of Ireland I havent done any of the great Neolithic sites of Ireland and I would love to have done Navan fort and places like that Much of his performance work evaporated overnight when the first lockdown hit back in March although he is grateful that some of the documentaries were able to resume when the restrictions loosened I was very lucky to be able to do a TV series about the Thames River which involved me being out and about he says Once lockdown finished I was able to go and do this eightpart series and then a fourpart history series which Im doing even as we speak From that point of view Ive been able to work for all but about two months of the epicentre of the lockdown Sir Tony says lockdown meant being able to spend more time at home in London with his wife Louise and still seeing a bit of his children Laura and Luke and his two grandchildren who live nearby For me it meant having more close time with my wife more than we have ever had before We got a rescue Westie three days before lockdown and its the light of our lives he says He also lost two stone in weight thanks to his bike Being I knew you shouldnt be overweight particularly not in lockdown I made a list of major books in Western literature that I wanted to read and I read of them There wasnt much I missed my kids live close by so my daughter would stand on her balcony of her flat and I would walk the dog and we would have conversations at that distance It was lovely Fortunately noone in his close family was badly affected by Covid although there were friends who werent as lucky Thats when you really understand the impact of it But the great revelation over lockdown he says has been the recognition of what a lifeline built and natural heritage have been for those isolated from everyday life I think for a huge amount of people many more than we expected there is a sense of the open places and historic spaces that we have that wasnt there before among lots and lots of people he says He pays tribute to the people who are battling to keep these historic treasures up and running and available to their communities despite losing many of their revenue streams If there is one small silver lining to lockdown its the fact that so many people became more aware of them he says I think that after Covid there will be quite a rethinking of the value of our open spaces so many people have realised what a lifeline they are There are lottery figures which show that to of people say they are using their outside spaces more and that has helped their mental health and wellbeing When lockdown hit he says he wasnt aware of quite how much pressure the people looking after historic castles and buildings and other sites were under Suddenly youve lost all your funding streams you cant raise the money and by definition what youve got is crumbling Old things do that its part of being an old thing Many of these heritage treasures required enormous renovations which became much more difficult to fund and this work was often being carried out by only a handful of staff while everyone else was furloughed The tiny silver lining is that once people arent going to your thing anymore it can ultimately lead to all the repairs and improvements being done provided youve got the money to do it he says Sir Tony is delighted to be involved in the National Lottery campaign celebrating the unsung heroes who are doing that vital work and commends the work carried out by William Colvin see interview overleaf and his team in Cushendun to keep the Old Church Centre carrying out its vital community role Its really quite exciting theres a deconsecrated church in Cushendun which was restored as a community arts and heritage centre and William has been working through lockdown to keep it functioning and make it easier for people to be there Its hard enough keeping things going in a big builtup area and its hard to get the resources during lockdown If something goes wrong getting parts can be really difficult I know the people who do this sort of work and they arent the kind of people we tend to celebrate To have this one evening when you project some of their faces onto Stonehenge and say those people are great is I think a lovely thing to do I think too often heritage is an addon Its not viewed as important like housing or education or the NHS but our heritage is vital open space is vital understanding who we are and where we come from is vital mental health is vital Its all part of our culture and if its not central to the life of our society we suffer greatly from it and I hope more and more politicians become aware of that Page How William Colvin and his team restored Cushendun Old Church Continued from page Chair of Cushendun Building Heritage Trust William Colvin is the only heritage campaigner from Northern Ireland whose image will be projected on to the sarsen stones at Stonehenge as part of the takeover Originally from Ballymena he became intrigued by the crumbling former Church of Ireland church in Cushendun when he moved to the village to join his partner Shea OHara I got involved with the Old Church Project nearly years ago as a volunteer there was an exhibition in the church of photographs and they were asking for people to help to save the building I got involved and joined the committee he says Cushendun Old Church was built in and was deconsecrated in In Cushendun Building Preservation Trust was set up with a view to saving it and restoring it as a community arts building William says At the time it was at severe risk as its condition had deteriorated and there were problems with water ingress and issues with damp All of the church furniture the altar the pews the reading desk had all been taken out of it and it was an empty hall with plaster hanging off the walls The stone floor was uneven and the wooden timbers were rotting William says At that time the BBC was running their programme Restoration Village and the group entered the old church in the competition It won the regional final for Northern Ireland which brought them a lot of attention but unfortunately it didnt win the overall final The group decided to press ahead on their own to raise the £ needed to restore the church and convert it into a community arts centre It took many years to negotiate a lease with the Church of Ireland We all work fulltime and can only commit a certain amount of time to it But eventually we negotiated a lease which allowed us some sort of ownership and helped us to get funding explains William We applied to the National Lottery fund and that gave us credibility and then we got some funds from the Causeway Coast and Glens council the Pilgrim Trust and Ulster Garden Villages By the builders were on the ground and in July last year the building was opened as a community arts and heritage centre The interior had been stripped back and restored the floor lifted and restored and a new air source heating system had been installed The crumbling old vestry was removed to be replaced with a twostorey extension with two bathrooms a kitchen and office space and the bell tower was restored with the rotting timbers supporting the bell replaced and the stained glass windows taken out and restored Since then the Old Church Centre has been hosting yoga classes art classes a musical evening with a string quintet from the Ulster Orchestra popular lectures and talks and even a performance by rock group Runabay William describes it as a hub of activity Its really diverse we didnt want to narrow it down to a single group It was an incredible feeling the first day I walked in and saw the work finished and the lights on and everything clean and bright It meant all the blood sweat and tears were really worth it The news about the Stonehenge takeover has been very exciting and unexpected he says Its very exciting and I feel incredibly privileged Its very unexpected and I feel very humbled by it Its not just me its the entire team of the committee members I couldnt have done it without the support of all our members Im very grateful and humbled for this recognition and its all very exciting I am just a finance officer in the health service who had a passion for stopping this building from falling into a complete wrack and ruin Im very grateful and humbled for this recognition and its all very exciting

Northern Ireland A Christmas like no other Tips for a Covid Christmas from making sure there is proper ventilation in the house to avoiding hugging your grandparents CHRISTMAS Day evokes memories of quality family time the scent of mulled wine pulled crackers and of course the turkey and ham dinner but means this is a very different festive season A brief relaxation of the rules allowing up to three households to mix for one day anytime between yesterday and Sunday came as a relief to many But this could cause a range of headaches for families across Northern Ireland as they try and keep their loved ones safe on Christmas Day Usually grandparents children aunts uncles mums and dads descend on each others homes but for this year at least someone will have to miss out if not all due to limited bubbles Health experts have said that just because the government has given us the green light to briefly mix households this Christmas that doesnt mean we have to So what could Christmas Day in look like Can I pass my granny a bottle of Shloer Can my niece hand me a present Will I be able to open a Christmas cracker with my brother Can my mate pass me a pint at a restaurant Will church services go ahead Westminsters Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies SAGE issued safety tips It recommended moving celebrations outside if possible putting hand sanitiser at the front door no touching games or rowdy singing So too limiting numbers posting gifts going virtual and not double dipping the canapes For many Christmas Day begins with children racing downstairs to see what Santa delivered and presents being shared Public health expert Dr Gabriel Scally recommended that the best thing to do this Christmas is have gifts delivered to your loved ones homes as delivery men and women have been properly trained in stopping the spread of the virus Some people have also tended to leave their delivery for a day or two to make sure the virus is dead or they wipe it down before they open it he said Thats a difficult thing to do if a loved one is giving you a gift You dont want to make it look like you dont trust them I think we have all got to be very respectful of each other People in their teens or would think nothing of Covid as they may not know anyone their age who has suffered from it Their guard may be down but Im sure older people will be concerned and I think its really important that relatives dont impose upon people this Christmas As Christmas morning continues it is usually time to visit relatives or get the home ready ahead of their arrival for the big day Many people also attend their local church for the Christmas Day service but Shankill Church of Ireland Parish in Lurgan has decided to prerecord this years service and broadcast it online Rev Mark Harvey explained that his church can hold a maximum of people but attendances have dropped to just due to social distancing regulations However Shankill still plans on hosting Midnight Communion tonight Rather than plan a service in church what we are going to do is record a snappy and light family orientated service that people can watch at home as families Mr Harvey explained Well have the Christmas Eve Communion about oclock and that will go past just after midnight Logistically Communion itself is a bit of a nightmare and it will actually be the first time well have had a Communion in quite some months Just like many churches across Northern Ireland Shankill Parish has installed the necessary broadcasting equipment during the pandemic We now have that facility in the long term added Mr Harvey Bellies will begin to rumble as the countdown to the Christ mas dinner continues and relatives start to mix in each others homes Dr Tom Black who chairs the British Medical Association in Northern Ireland suggested a good way to limit contact is to use more than one room in your home and spread your guests out He did admit that wearing a face mask when youre not eating or drinking will be a challenge especially on Christmas Day We always talk about limiting the amount of time you have in a room and increasing the ventilation but all those things are so difficult at Christmas and you nearly think the whole thing is working against you he said One of the things that is really worth working on is being aware that if youre going to a family gathering and theres older members and vulnerable people there you can certainly take due care and respect by not going out and gallivanting You should be careful in this period coming up to Christmas knowing that youre going to meet your elderly and vulnerable relatives Dont hug your granny and for once at Christmas give your granny the elbow rather than hugging her because its safer for her Meanwhile Dr Scally said the best option is to behave as if you have and you dont want to pass it on to your loved ones If people do decide to meet each other over the festive season Dr Scally stressed that precautions must be taken Theres nothing more important than grandparents to their grandchildren and grandchildren to their grandparents he continued This is a great time of love affection and generosity and so on but Christmas in a time of Covid cant be like that without it being risky Perhaps a socially distant Christmas Day walk with your loved ones is the best way to spend time together Dr Scally said that if this is not possible ventilation in your home is key to keeping it as safe as possible Maybe open a window at the front of the house and one at the back of the house and keep doors open to create a draft he added Remember all the usual stuff like social distancing and wiping down surfaces that people have been touching Make sure you are careful about sharing plates cutlery or glasses Avoid all of that Meanwhile Shankill Parish placed a Christmas tree outside the grounds of the church this year and called it A Tree of Hope The idea was to allow people to come into the grounds at their own leisure and write their hopes and fears on stars which will then hang on the tree We wouldnt have done this any other year and it doesnt matter if people are church goers or not theres still a lot of anxiety and fear about but theres a bit of hope now with this vaccine on the horizon said Mr Harvey We just want to give people a chance to express that Maybe open a window at the front of the house and one at the back of the house and keep doors open to create a draft Dont hug your granny because its safer for her

denomination Last year the Church of Ireland marked the anniversary of the ordination of women a very important milestone As a woman and in particular as a female politician I greatly appreciate the importance of female leaders within our communities and our Church I have been impressed and inspired by many female clergy and continue to be inspired Women are underrepresented in so many fields in sport media and politics and the importance of the messaging If you cant see it you cant be it is as applicable in the Church as it is in these other fields Q Are you afraid to die Or can you look beyond death AIm not afraid to die but unfortunately its a fate that awaits us all What I do fear is leaving my children behind Q What do you think about people of other denominations and other faiths A Having lived all my life in Dublin as a member of the Church of Ireland I have always been comfortable being in the minority religion So while I attended Protestant schools I had many friends and colleagues of other denominations and faiths and of none I have always valued a persons attitude and kindness towards others above a judgment of them based on their faith or denomination Q Would you be comfortable in stepping out from your own faith and trying to learn something from other people A Absolutely Its important to continue to learn from other people in order to develop a deeper understanding of the world Q Why are so many people turning their backs on organised religion A One positive that has come from the pandemic is that although our church doors have been closed for many months technology has brought the Church into our homes again Many people who had fallen away from the Church have now found a way back in again Q Has religion helped or hindered the people of Northern Ireland A On the surface its clear that religion has played a large part in the complicated recent history of Northern Ireland Still it could be said that it was those who ignored the precepts of religious teachings that contributed to violence and more importantly it was those with deeplyheld religious beliefs who were so instrumental in brokering peace Q What is your favourite film book and music and why AWhen I have the opportunity to watch a film that isnt a Disney or Pixar animated feature I enjoy a war movie Dunkirk and have been recent favourites I play the cello and the piano though I dont dust off my cello as often as I should My Spotify playlists wouldnt reveal too much about my favourite music as I tend to play everything from Vivaldi to Prodigy depending on my mood or the weather I like crime fiction though the most recent book which has really left a mark on me is American Dirt by Jeanine Cummins Q Where do you feel closest to God At Glencolmcille in southwest Co Donegal which is the ancestral home of my father and where I spend most of my holiday time The wild raw beauty of the place makes me appreciate the wonder of His creation and its easy to switch off from city life and reconnect to what matters especially as the broadband signal is terrible up there have you any major regrets Q Finally AI try to look to the future instead of worrying about the past

the Corners Festival in Belfast which takes place next month Q Can you tell us something about your background AI was born in Maine in the USA and brought up in a village of people My father Carl was a builder and my mother Jennie worked in a blueberry processing factory Sadly she passed away in I have two older sisters Becky and Carla I am and married to Brian ONeill a web developer from Belfast I attended Providence College in Rhode Island on an athletic scholarship so I got a free university education in return for running crosscountry and track My running coaches and many teammates were Irish I came to Ireland in and did an MA and PhD in Politics at University College Dublin I lectured for nine years at the Irish School of Ecumenics in Belfast and I have been at Queens since where I am Reader in Sociology I represented Northern Ireland in the Commonwealth Games in coming in the marathon I have also run for Ireland in two European Championships Q How and when did you come to faith AI was raised in an independent Baptist church Coming to faith meant consciously accepting Christ which I did at the age of seven in a Sunday school class I now attend Fitzroy Presbyterian Church in Belfast this faith only for Sundays QIs A Theres no point in having faith unless it plays a real part in your life Christian faith should make you more kind forgiving and motivated to make society fairer and more just But I do not always live up to this ideal Q Have you ever had a crisis of faith or a gnawing doubt about your faith A Religions have changed tremendously throughout history and continue to change Its wrong to assume that our particular religion has all the right answers we should have questions about our faith If we dont have doubts about some things were not thinking hard enough Q Have you ever been angry with God and if so why A The injustice and suffering in the world make me angry but not with God Blaming God can be a way of evading our responsibilities to change things for the better Q Do you ever get criticised for your faith and are you able to live with that criticism AI have got more criticism from people inside my own tradition It doesnt trouble me because you can learn a lot through criticisms Q Are you ever ashamed of your own Church or denomination A In the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church barred samesex couples from membership and banned baptism for their children It was pastorally disastrous and potentially undermines the Presbyterian Churchs positive witness in other areas Q Are you afraid to die or can you look beyond death AI have some anxiety about a physically painful death or losing mental faculties but thats different from an existential fear of death you afraid of hell QAre ANo I believe in a God of infinite mercy and forgiveness Q Do you believe in a resurrection and if so what will it be like AIm not interested in speculation on what resurrection will be like Jesus had more to say about how we should be

as if they are Christ For me thats a helpful way to think about people of other denominations and faiths Q Would you be comfortable in stepping out from your faith and trying to learn from other people A Yes that could be considered the job description for a sociologist of religion I also help organise the Corners Festival an interChurch festival in Belfast in February events are designed to encourage people to step out from their own faith and learn from others Q Do you think that the Churches here are fulfilling their mission A Partially But I remain puzzled that more Christians have not seen peacebuilding and reconciliation as central to living out their faith in a divided society Q Why are so many people turning their backs on organised religion A For many reasons including largescale global processes like modernisation economic growth and technological and scientific advances which have challenged the viability of all societal institutions including organised religions which have not always responded well to these developments especially when they police their boundaries instead of reaching out to people in compassion Q Has religion helped or hindered the people of Northern Ireland A Both During the Troubles the institutional Churches didnt promote peacemaking enough However many clergy acted as first responders providing pastoral care to the grieving Socalled ordinary Christians were quiet witnesses for peace in their communities and some courageous clergy promoted peacemaking My books Considering Grace Presbyterians and the Troubles coauthored with Jamie Yohanis and Unity Pilgrim The Life of Fr Gerry Reynolds tell some of those stories My recent research on religion during the pandemic has also shown that Churches are providing valuable support and social services for people during this time Q What is your favourite film book and music and why AI was an American Civil War buff so the movie Gettysburg remains a favourite I enjoy books by authors associated with the emerging Church like Rob Bell Peter Rollins and Phyllis Tickle because they make me think Johnny Cashs music faces up to human darkness and despair but through the lens of an authentic spirituality Q Where do you feel closest to God running AWhile have you any major regrets Q Finally A No although at times I have been disappointed in myself for the manner in which I have responded to the difficulties that have come my way

Lee Keown tells Linda Stewart how she came to muster a small army of Co Down knitters to help create her new sustainable fashion brand I T was never supposed to happen this way says New York designer Yuri Lee Keown She had planned to come to Kilkeel in spring last year to marry her fiance Thomas Keown but thanks to the pandemic she found herself stranded in Northern Ireland unable to go ahead with longheld plans to return to the States to launch a fashion line Instead she found herself debuting her Love Wonky brand from a sheep farm in the Mournes and recruiting her motherinlaws friends to knit hats and scarves that retail for up to in the States The designer who is of Korean descent has been part of the industry for years working for big names such as DKNY Victorias Secret and Anthropologie A few years ago she began working for the sustainable lifestyle brand Amour Vert in San Francisco The brand expanded hugely in the following years with Yuri becoming a designer with the right car the right apartment the right social circle and the right metrics Once she had acquired all those things however she encountered the ageold problem of finding they werent as fulfilling as expected Three years ago something broke in me I thought This isnt the way I want to live even though I was doing fashion in a kinder way Yuri says I had achieved all the goals I had set out to be successful I lacked nothing materially but my life lacked purpose and meaning I was a part of an industry that was very good at telling you what you needed to look sexier cooler smarter but I didnt know how to make my own life more meaningful I had seen the worst of the fashion industry and the ways in which people who produce the things we wear are exploited and mistreated I believed there was a better way and I wanted to use my experience to help find it I had no idea how so I quit my job put my things into storage and set out on a journey spending six months in Africa and India I didnt know how but I knew I had to do something that helped people who werent me It was around this time that she fell for Northern Irelandborn Thomas Keown whom she met at a friends wedding in Brooklyn When she was looking for an organisation to volunteer with someone suggested she contact Thomas the cofounder of the Many Hopes organisation a nonprofit based in Manhattan and London which aims to rescue children from poverty and abuse and equip them with the tools to tackle injustice When she met up with Thomas things did not go as planned She soon realised that her skills as a fashion designer were not what Many Hopes needed but the meeting did lead to the start of their relationship While he was very gentle in letting me down the next time we were in New York we met up and talked a little bit more Yuri says Thats how our relationship began with a series of noes In so many ways he said that their work was with orphans and they cant have people coming in and out of their lives When I came back from my travels I wanted to be really conscious of how much I didnt know and I wanted to offer something that people would need I would try to learn from our conversations After travelling around and making connections with organisations in other countries Yuri realised that while many women in developing countries were unable to access schooling they had often learned craft skills from the older generations that could be adapted to earning a living Her intention was to work closely with women in Latin America to create beautiful handmade garments that could be sold via her Love Wonky brand while at the same time generating employment The plan was to launch a partnership with a nonprofit in Bolivia in followed by another nonprofit in Guatemala this year but Covid changed everything I was going to go back to work with the women and collaborate on designs and do sam pling then the pandemic hit Yuri explains At the same time her Kilkeel wedding plans were thrown into disarray The plan was to get married in May My family was coming from Korea and we had a bunch of friends coming from the US she tells me I started hearing about Covid in Korea in midFebruary so in April I decided to come to Northern Ireland a little bit early to see what the situation was like and monitor things But come April last year we had to cancel all our plans because everything was shutting down We were supposed to have our wedding in Thomass home church in Kilkeel and have the reception at the Green Cottages but it was postponed to September and then it was going to be postponed to May this year Adding to their problems was Donald Trumps decision to close the USs borders to nonessential workers meaning Thomas was unable to return to New York The choice for me was between going back to the States by myself or staying in Kilkeel where I dont have a community I couldnt even drive Yuri explains It felt like a bit of a hard decision but what I hadnt anticipated was just how warm the community was here I really love it here which is surprising because Ive always lived in big cities like New York or Seoul Ive never even lived in a house before Thomas adds We ran into a thousand administrative and legal issues that would have been comical if they werent so hard and frustrating Weddings were banned here so we thought wed go and get married in America instead then America closed the borders to Europeans so Yuri could go there but I couldnt The next option was to do it here later but then we realised Yuris visa would expire before we could do that She was already here so it was very hard to get a wedding visa to enter a country she was already in Later weddings were allowed outdoors but the Church of Ireland can only marry people inside church buildings Finally we got a ceremony in front of seven members of my family and two iPhones Zooming to Korea Yuris plans for launching her new brand had been thrown into disarray by the pandemic in part because the women she was working with lived in remote areas and were unable able to move around because of Covid roadblocks Even if they had been able to continue working they were unable to move their products Because of the lack of work and tourism in their area their income was badly hit Yuri remembers receiving a text from one of the women she was working with in Bolivia who was trying to care for four children with no income These were people Id spent time with and I wanted to help in some way she says Inspired by the women in Thomass family Yuri came up with the idea of recruiting local knitters to create handmade garments that could be sold and the profits used to generate employment in Latin America Since moving to Kilkeel and seeing how many people here want to help the less fortunate around the world seeing how many people love to knit and knowing how many people in the States desire handmade goods this idea jumped out as a win for everyone she says The idea first came about because of Thomass grandmother Sadie who despite never leaving Northern Ireland knitted almost every night for years for premature babies in Malawi that she would never meet I wondered if there might be more Sadies around and goodness there were She started off with two or three Kilkeel ladies knitting hats and scarves to sell under the Love Wonky brand The idea quickly caught on That turned into five six seven and all of a sudden we had ladies knitting for us Theyre so fast that I was surprised The demand has been surprising I think people really like that its handknit and they like the fact that when they purchase its going to a good cause Yuri says One of her volunteer knitters Ruth Johnson describes the project as a win win win Its a win for the ladies in Northern Ireland to be able to help someone else a win for the ladies in Guatemala and Bolivia to gain steady employment and a win for the customer who gets a beautiful hat that also helps someone she says Rathfriland knitter Elizabeth Watterson who has been knitting for Love Wonky since October adds Its nice to know you can sit on your sofa with your fire lit knit a wee bit and realise that you are helping another lady in another country and theres a reward in doing it a wee satisfaction for yourself Yuri named the brand Love Wonky because she believes the beauty of handmade products lies in their imperfections We believe that handmade goods carry a soul that factory made goods never can she explains We believe that your clothes should be as unique as you are and that every purchase you make can and should make a difference To be able to do something that we enjoy doing anyway and also know that it is helping a woman on the other side of the world gives our knitters a good feeling While Yuri is delighted with her brands performance shes also loving life in Kilkeel Im learning new words and pronunciations that soda bread is something that exists and that you can never drink too many cups of tea she says The difference between the pace of life and the attitude of people here I just love it even the little things like waving at people over the steering wheel when you meet them driving Wherever Wonky goes in the decades ahead it will always be the kindness of Northern Ireland that started it That this was also able to provide ladies with something meaningful to do with their time and skill during lockdown is so perfect for what Wonky seeks to be in the world To learn more about Yuris fashion brand visit I lacked nothing materially I was in an industry that told you how to look cooler but I didnt know how make life meaningful Wherever Love Wonky goes in the decades that lie ahead it will always be the kindness of Northern Ireland that started it

is thriving for those whore working in a historic part of Belfast says Lorraine Wylie I N the Townsend Street in west Belfast was quite literally the street at the end of the town But when Robert Shipboy MacAdam and brother James set up the Soho Foundry his ingenuity and imagination knew no bounds In his design for a steam engine the largest ever produced in Ireland and capable of pumping an incredible gallons of water per minute ended up in Egypt as part of the Niles irrigation system A lifelong Presbyterian Mac Adam was also a keen linguist with a passion for the Irish language He went on to become a founding member of the Ulster Gaelic Society Today MacAdams company is long gone and Townsend Street is no longer the end of the town But the same entrepreneurial spirit is very much alive in the area now known as The Townsend Enterprise Park Over businesses are located in the Enterprise Park and industries include graphic design ceramics butcher car and bike parts and repairs and charitable organisations The Park provides employment for approximately from people across the city and beyond In it celebrated occupancy the first time in its trading history all the more significant when amid the pandemic Margaret Patterson McMahon CEO of the Enterprise Park discusses why the history of the area could help secure its future When I came here in I loved the energy of the place From manufacturing and ser vices to charity bases and coffee roasters theres such a diverse range of businesses Prior to working here I had no idea it was such an historical goldmine Once I learned about the Soho Foundry I realised it could be an incredible opportunity to promote us on a much bigger scale Margarets brainchild the Made in Townsend Street campaign was launched in September How did she come up with the plan The Park sits on the interface where the peace gates have become a major tourist attraction Every day coaches and taxis brought a stream of visitors to see the gates It occurred to me that people were hearing only one chapter in our history and there is so much more to Northern Ireland than the Troubles The individuals who helped Belfast evolve into the vibrant city it is today have a fascinating story Robert Shipboy MacAdam just one of those distinguished citizens had his foundry on our site Just next door theres the beautiful Townsend Street Presbyterian church dating back to the early century Unfortunately no one sees beyond the gates I dont want to take anything away for our history I just want to widen it out She isnt short of ideas on how to bring the past to life We considered using one of the old church buildings to recreate a century school experience Perhaps initially we could reimagine the history of Townsend Street by creating a story wall post little facts about the past at spaced intervals from the bottom of the Falls Road right up to the peace gates at Townsend Street the end of the town The possibilities are endless Two of the businesses located in the Enterprise Park have shared their experiences of being in such an iconic location Like their trading neighbours theyre doing what is possible to survive during Covid and to thrive once restrictions have lifted Belfast Coffee Roasters Situated on the actual site of the old Soho Foundry Belfast Coffee Roasters enjoys a unique location The hiss of steam engines no longer fills the air but for owners Allen Cox and Rod Bell the aroma of success lingers on Originally from London Allen explains how he went from selling alcohol in the West End to roasting coffee in Northern Ireland My wife Fiona is from Lisburn and although we enjoyed living in London when our son was born we decided wed like to be closer to family Prior to coming here in Id worked for Scottish and Newcastle breweries My main experience of coffee was the endless cups of espresso I drank to keep me awake while working late An opportunity to get involved with a coffee franchise opened the door to a new career I ran the franchise for almost eight years but was ready for a new challenge Rod Bell and I had been discussing coffee roasting and somehow the idea grew Eventually in we set up the Belfast Coffee Roasters bought a coffee roaster and in March started roasting at the Townsend Enterprise Park How has the businesss unique location played into its success We didnt have a logo so I began researching the area hoping for ideas When I came across the story of the Soho Foundry and how it helped drive the growth of the city we immediately wanted to use it in our design The result a reflection of the Belfast Coffee Roasters as a sort of cottage industry set within the industrial context of Belfast is perfect The logo has definitely become a selling point as it encourages customers to ask questions and I love to share Belfasts history Allens knowledge about his subject is impressive The coffee bean isnt actually a bean he says Its actually a seed There are two main types of coffee Arabica and Robusta The former grows at a much higher altitude and is the most popular I like Kenya filter coffee which is slightly acidic fruity and slightly more floral Rossis Ice Creams Businesswoman Anita McCann got her slice of history in when she bought Belfasts oldest icecream shop Rossis Ice Creams Id been working in IT but I wasnt happy she says When Rossis Ice Cream shop on the Antrim Road came on the market it seemed a good opportunity I had no experience but with a history dating back to Rossis was well established and loved by everyone I decided to take a leap of faith Anitas instinct paid off and by business was booming Soon she was looking for new premises The Townsend Street Enterprise Park situated less than a mile from the City Hall where we do the Christmas Market and close to the Westlink was handy to everything and an ideal location What makes a good ice cream Far from the complex process Id imagined its surprisingly simple The ingredients are put into an industrial sized very expensive machine which works the magic and produces beautiful ice cream However the actual ingredients a recipe thats been in the Rossi family since cant be divulged Owning an ice cream factory sounds like heaven does she find it hard to resist In the beginning I was eating it all the time she laughs Fortunately the novelty factor wore off and I manage to keep it as a treat Anita and husband Paul an architect have four children and she discusses how she juggles business with family life Well I have great staff that I can rely on My husband Paul is an amazing support and helps me with the children To be honest I couldnt do it without him I try to find a balance but like most working mums I sometimes feel I could be giving more to both areas It all works out What does the future hold We recently added ice cream birthday cakes to our range but the big news is that were opening a second shop in Yorkgate hopefully in April Im really excited about it Businesses have been hit particularly hard by lockdown but Anitas experience is more positive We had to close last March but in some ways I was actually relieved It felt safer and I was glad to be home with my family Government support proved a financial lifeline Now we can just look forward to better times and enjoy the good things One of those good things is a family day out rounded off with a familiar treat Every Thursday we take the children to the park followed by a trip to the ice cream shop DID YOU KNOW Robert Shipboy MacAdam published a Gaelic dictionary and amassed a collection of Gaelic proverbs He was a lifelong campaigner for the study of the Irish language Townsend Street National School opened One of Belfasts first Maternity lyingin Hospitals opened at Townend Street in Belfast takes its name from the old The Farset River which can still be seen from the Townend site Now we can just look forward to better times

Northern Ireland In conversation with RACHEL MILLER RACHEL Miller is a schools worker with the Scripture Union Q Can you tell us something about yourself AI am and I began working for the Scripture Union as the north west schools worker after graduating with a Bachelor of Theology from Queens University Belfast in August I am the eldest of three children and I live with my family in DerryLondonderry My parents are Alison and Robert and I have a brother Peter and a sister Laura Q How and when did you come to faith A As the daughter of a Church of Ireland minister I have grown up surrounded by Christian influences I knew and understood a relationship with Jesus to be an essential part of who I was and how I lived But it wasnt until my early teens at Summer Madness a Christian youth festival that I grasped Gods unconditional love From then on how I chose to live was an act of worship rooted in love not obligation Q Have you ever had a crisis of faith or a gnawing doubt about your faith AIve never doubted the existence of God but there have been times when I have wondered if life without God would be easier Sometimes worldliness can be attractive However Gods faithfulness and the goodness of His truth has never allowed me to fall away Q Have you ever been angry with God and if so why AI feel blessed to have never experienced something which has provoked me to be angry with God However this pandemic has definitely caused me to cry Why to God But isnt it much better to wrestle with God in our struggles than to isolate ourselves from Him There is intimacy in wrestling I think thats the beauty of lamenting Q Do you ever get criticised for your faith and are you able to live with that criticism never really been criticised AIve I think sometimes people write Christians off as being naive or judgmental and I hate that misunderstanding Not necessarily because it harms my ego but because those are not accurate reflections of God and His word Q Are you ever ashamed of your own Church or denomination AI think its important to acknowledge the Churchs shortcomings and I certainly hold my own frustrations with it However I try to remind myself that Christ loves the Church The Church is Gods gift to us a vessel through which we can fulfil His mission I know God can work through our imperfect efforts Q Do you believe in a resurrection and if so what will it be like A Yes its something which fills me with hope This pandemic has brought to the surface the overwhelming brokenness and injustices of this world but I am encouraged by the words of Revelation that remind us that our allpowerful God of love and justice will make everything new according to His will I dont know what that will look like but I trust it will be immeasurably more than we could ever imagine Q Are you afraid to die or can you look beyond death A My fear of missing out screams Yes I dont want to die before Ive experienced and achieved all that I want to achieve But I know that even my ideal earthly life could never compare to the perfection of eternal life with God you afraid of hell QAre A Not for myself because I am convinced that nothing can ever separate us from Gods love not even the powers of hell Romans NIV But I do fear and mourn for those I love who dont know God Q What do you think about people of other denominations and other faiths A Growing up Anglican studying at a Presbyterian College going to a joint Methodist and Church of Ireland church and now working for the Scripture Union has led me to conclude that diversity and unity are not mutually exclusive As long as we all humbly acknowledge the mystery of God and are open to learning from each other we can continue to spur each other on as we work out our faith in the same God Q Would you be comfortable in stepping out from your own faith and trying to learn something from other people A Yes its important to acknowledge that we arent always going to get it right However I will never leave my faith behind its central to who I am Q Do you think that the Churches here are fulfilling their mission think the majority are striving AI to As someone who gets to visit lots of churches and share the vision of schoolss ministry it is encouraging to see how churches are fulfilling their mission in different ways However our efforts are imperfect and often we fall short Q Why are so many turning their backs on organised religion A Todays culture promotes selfimprovement selfempowerment and independence therefore I think many simply dont see the need for organised religion I also think that the term has been tainted even as a Christian the term conjures negative connotations It feels impersonal cold and irrelevant the opposite of the Gospel message which teaches freedom and radical hospitality Q Has religion helped or hindered the people of Northern Ireland A It depends who you speak to I think its important to address both the joy and deep pain it has brought people Q What is your favourite film book and music and why A Its hard to find a musical genre I dont like it ranges from Chopin to Stormzy I am a massive Taylor Swift fan Some of my favourite books are the ones I studied in school To Kill a Mockingbird The Great Gatsby and Jane Eyre My favorite films are the Mama Mia movies Its hard to resist Abbas tunes Q Where do you feel closest to God A By the sea Theres something about the vastness of the ocean that reminds me of my insignificance and yet Gods intimate love for me Q What inscription would you like on your gravestone if any AI think Id leave the decision up to my nearest and dearest have you any major regrets Q Finally ANo Hindsight is a wonderful thing but theres no point being burdened by the past

prepare to reopen for Easter four clerics tell of the challenges of lockdown and the crosses parishioners had to bear MARCH is a date etched in the minds of clergy of all denominations across Northern Ireland It was Mothering Sunday but also the day that religious services took on a very different form Following the health advice over social gatherings churches turned to technology to spread the word using live streaming and prerecorded messages on websites and social media platforms Four months later saw a full return to church services weeks after initially reopening for private prayer only but with smaller congregations no hymnsinging and amid strict government guidelines around hygiene and social distancing Throughout all of this weddings and funerals continued within the limits and constraints of changing regulations In January of this year the four main churches voluntarily suspended inperson gatherings due to the latest lockdown but last week confirmed they will return to public worship in time for Easter Reflecting on the past months Fr Edward McGee a priest of the Diocese of Down and Connor says while church doors have been physically closed for most of the last year pastoral mission prayer and ministry continued Mirroring the resilience of wider society those early days of shock and disorientation during those first months of the pandemic quickly gave way to a mobilisation of volunteerism innovation and creativity Fr McGee said He adds that lockdown prompted the church to look at new ways to accommodate the ongoing spiritual sacramental and pastoral needs of the people it served Parishes put in place measures that would allow people to safely gather for prayer and to employ media and technologies to reach out to those who were selfisolating and at home Clergy started streaming liturgies through newly installed webcams and social media and held virtual parish meetings on online platforms that heretofore had only been the realm of computer experts and technical wizards Now with Holy Week and Easter approaching Fr McGee says there is a profound sense of consolation hope and joy that accompanies the return again to public worship There is also a flurry of activity within our parishes to carry out risk assessments reactivate the measures already put in place to keep parishioners safe and to mobilise again the volunteers who have sanitised churches and facilitated public liturgies Fr McGee says the last year has brought much suffering and pain and there is a need for healing and reconnection as we emerge as a society from the hold of the pandemic The greatest cross has been carried by those who have lost loved ones as they have been unable to observe the rites and rituals associated with mourning that are so much part of our faith and culture he added The pandemic has also had a profound impact on education business and brought economic hardship and insecurity to families It will take time for us all to recover and heal the wounds of the pandemic but we will recover and we approach the future together with the Easter hope of resurrection Rev Joanne Smith was just getting into her stride as a firsttime minister at Caledon and Minterburn Presbyterian Churches in Co Tyrone when everything changed I now have a large file on my computer called Coronatide she reflects Its full of hastily pulled together Sunday sermons and talks for our online midweek services from those early lockdown weeks a year ago when many of us honestly had no idea what we were doing or how to do it We started recording services on our phones and we are still doing that Teenagers and teachers edited them and like everyone else we got very used to Zoom and distance A year later Rev Joanne says everything is the same but also different Everything is the same in that we are still zooming and recording services though we now record in the church which is much better she explains We still have no inperson meetings and while there are things that can be done on Zoom like our prayer meetings so many things cant like mums and tots groups which have just stopped I really want to be with people but as time has gone on simple staying in contact has also got harder but we are getting there Thankfully everything is also different People are now being vaccinated some of our more senior members are about to get their second and we have heard this week that we will be able to return to church for Easter she said And looking ahead to her third Easter as a minister Rev Joanne added It will be different from last year but in a good way as we will be able to meet and we will be able to celebrate together that on the third day Jesus rose again and the hope that brings especially in these tired days Rev Gareth Harron rector of St Philip and St James Church of Ireland in Holywood Co Down feels that we took a great deal for granted before last March Its a cliché but we have learned to appreciate something of what church is really about he said As we moved our services online we werent caught completely cold We had been recording services for distribution on DVD for some years but we needed to get up to speed with live streaming While we know that not everyone has access to technology going online with things like our bible studies prayer meetings fellowship groups select vestry meetings bookgroups etc has opened up engagement beyond our parish boundaries We have been joined by people from around the globe For Rev Gareth the main challenges to pastoral ministry were having to grieve with families faced with limiting the numbers attending funeral services and being unable to visit hospitals and nursing homes I am hopeful that the lessons we have learned will make us better equipped to support people that church might not just go back to normal but might actually feel better he adds I am looking forward to meeting around the Lords table this Easter no outdoor dawn service no breakfast afterwards but blessed by the opportunity to give thanks with the church family whether in person or online united by the good news of hope in Christ which transcends lockdowns and social distancing Rev Dr Heather Morris general secretary of the Methodist Church in Ireland says the past year has been as challenging for churches as it has been for the whole of society The grief of those who have lost loved ones through these months has been heightened by the necessary restrictions on visiting and funerals but ministers have been on the frontline of support for these families Dr Morris said Churches have run and been part of community helplines to support those who cant get out whether that was delivering prescriptions or groceries simply being available on the phone for a chat or offering prayer She adds There was undoubtedly initial shock and readjustment to this new landscape but Methodist churches responded with imagination and creativity asking what can we do rather than focussing on the things that couldnt be done in the circumstances a community choir in South Belfast met online and churches have been able restrictions allowing to keep foodbanks running When buildings were closed for gathered worship most Methodist churches moved online for Sunday services and midweek Bible Studies prayer meetings and Alpha courses and many found that they were being joined not just by the usual congregation but by others who were interested Some congregations in Enniskillen Togherdoo Lisbellaw and many others have run very popular drivein services Along with other churches members of the Methodist church will be praying on Easter Sunday for recovery from the pandemic healing peace and renewed hope for the whole community It will take time to heal the wounds of Covid

Northern Ireland In conversation with REV DR LESLIE HOLMES Rev Dr Leslie Holmes is a distinguished Ulsterborn preacher and academic in the USA who once played with Van Morrison He has been married to Barbara for years and they have two children Gary and Erin and two grandchildren Hannah and Cameron you tell us about your background QCan AI was born in Belfast in My parents were Robbie and Isobel My sister Pauline Hanna is married to Walter and lives in Lisburn My other sister Sandra Potter is married to Billy and lives in Moira I attended Queen Victoria Primary and Suffolk Primary and later Larkfield Secondary School and Belfast Tech My wife Barbara and I were in the same class at the old Queen Victoria Primary We connected later when we both worked at the Belfast Coop in York Street In we were married at the College Square Presbyterian Church in Belfast where we both had been baptised We have two children Gary is a commander with the US Navy at the Walter Reed Hospital and Erin is a purser with Delta Airlines Our grandchildren are Hannah and Cameron about your clerical career QWhat A Prior to becoming Moderator of the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church in America I was Provost and Professor of Preaching and Pastoral Theology at Erskine Theological Seminary in South Carolina For over years I was pastor to congregations from to members in Mississippi Georgia Florida California Pennsylvania and South Carolina I also offered the opening prayer to the US House of Representatives in Washington DC This is the year of my ministry Q How and when did you come to faith A My parents sowed gospel seeds early in my life but many times I allowed weeds to supplant them When I was about eight I had a real sense that God had His hand on me but spent much of my early adult life running away from that I was brought to a keen understanding of the Christian gospel soon after Barbara and I emigrated to the United States in with our theninfant son Gary Until then I had a working understanding of religion to which I knew that I could never measure up My uncle Sam Heslip a Belfast man who was the pastor of a Presbyterian congregation on the Mississippi Gulf Coast brought me to a new understanding of salvation Not long after that Barbara also came to faith Q Have you ever been angry with God ANo However many times I tried to understand why certain things happen When for example a couple who have lost a child call on me for pastoral care I find myself asking God why children even little babies sometimes die In early ministry my first two funerals were for people younger than me I was A young mother just died of cancer A young man just and full of life who seemed to be on the verge of getting saved was run over and killed by one of his friends They were just horsing around There are many things that I do not understand but not to the point of being angry with God Still I become frustrated and I realise that God knows the answers and that one day I will know them too you afraid of hell QAre A No but I deserve it However Christ Jesus through His death on the cross and resurrection has saved me from it I believe in the resurrection of Gods son Jesus and His words Because I live you also will live Q Would you be comfortable in trying to learn from other people AI have met many people whose understanding of God is different from mine None of us has a monopoly of truth More than once these meetings provided an opportunity to learn Often they also opened an opportunity to share my belief that Christ Jesus alone is all truth Q Do you think that the Churches here are fulfilling their mission A Before the pandemic travel restrictions it was my privilege both to worship with and to preach to northern and southern Irish Christians each year What I witnessed there greatly encourages my heart about Irish Churches being faithful in fulfilling their mission Q Why are so many people turning their backs on organised religion live in an age of searching AWe We think we are better educated than any prior generation yet we are also greatly unsettled On both sides of the Atlantic our rates of chemical and alcohol abuse are stunning Sexual immorality is rampant Sometimes people turn from the Church because they have judged it by the imperfections of its people rather than the perfection of its saviour Jesus Q Has religion helped or hindered in Northern Ireland A Christianity has helped in Northern Ireland and indeed the world for centuries The Christian Church has given birth not just to churches but schools hospitals and agencies that benefit the whole of humanity However religion improperly presented or not fully understood has many times been a hindrance and Northern Ireland has seen its share of that Lets be fair however and recognise that in Northern Ireland alone more institutions to help people have been established by followers of Jesus Christ than by all other forces combined Q What is your favourite film book and music A The film is Chariots of Fire The book Still the Bible Music Beethovens Symphony Im a fan of almost all kinds of music I learned to play the cornet in the First Old Boys Band Later I played trumpet with The Monarchs including Van Morrison I still love a rousing march from a good brass band or the skirl of the pipes Q Where do you feel closest to God A In the mountains whether it is Divis the Mournes or the Great Smoky Mountains not far from where we live In any of these places my heart echoes Psalm Q What inscription would you like on your gravestone if any AI plan to give my body to medical science I do not expect a gravestone but I am hoping that people might say He was not much but he had a wonderful saviour you any major regrets QHave A Frank Sinatra sang Regrets Ive had a few I can neither say nor sing that for Ive had more than a few However by His grace none were so major that Christs grace on Calvarys cross did not cover them

National   Independent  Media Northern Ireland AMID all the revisiting of the character sensibility and quirks of Prince Philip one of his set rules in life will have struck a chord with many his demand that no sermon stray a second over eight minutes Certainly there will be those in this part of the world no stranger to pewnumb bum and dead leg who will have offered up a heartfelt thanks that finally their pain over many decades has been recognised Indeed the very word sermon will conjure up memories of counting all the panes in the stained glass windows furtive looks at the watch and the anxiety on your mothers face as she wondered if Sunday dinner would survive the ministers reflections on The Good Samaritan As with everything in Northern Ireland particularly during those years when Protestants and Catholics rarely stepped into each others churches suspicions loomed large that the other side was having it better Many a Protestant teenager had heard the legend that you could be out of Mass in half an hour by which stage their own minister was just beginning his slow climb into the pulpit Catholics on the other hand felt envious because of dark rumours that Protestants if they so wished actually didnt have to go to church at all Of course it was more complicated than that Denomination didnt necessarily offer a safeguard from the halfhour sermon or homily Catholic friends tell tales of watching eagerly to see which priest would emerge praying for Father McSpeedy A pal recalls one who spoke for so long parishioners would faint There were those interProtestant reckonings too As Church of Ireland we were told to count ourselves lucky we werent Presbyterians who apparently faced a particularly dry and stern service Humorous myths aside the Dukes eight minute rule does prompt an interesting and dare I say timely debate for the churchgoing community Lets be frank it takes a consummate performer to hold an audience captive for five minutes never mind or Showbusiness types spend years honing their craft relying on charisma timing humour and punchlines A sermon isnt entertainment as such but it should be engaging memorable illuminating even challenging or provocative The whole purpose is to stop you in your tracks and make you think about something more profound than simply when theyre going to wrap it up Of course there have been preachers famous for their oratorical skills such as the evangelist Billy Graham Some people even though they werent Free Presbyterians made a point of going to hear the late Rev Ian Paisley who was of the fire and brimstone tradition In the Eighties hundreds of students packed out the late Derick Binghams Tuesday night at the Crescent Church in Belfast Stories drawing on extremes of human experience are always compelling which is presumably why the testimony remains popular in many churches here Accounts of battling drink drugs or gambling or of killing in the Troubles only to have a life transformed by faith still draw a crowd Obviously the demands of delivering a weekly sermon or homily must be a very different experience Often the preacher must follow the liturgical year There must be times its hard to feel inspired to find a different way to make a point Whod blame clergy if theyve come to dread staring at the same faces Sunday after Sunday wondering if even a tiny fraction of what theyre saying will ever hit home Many people dread public speaking so getting up to preach no matter how great the call to do so takes courage It also requires patience understanding and stamina Imagine one year at work where youd to give weekly presentations No wonder wornout clergy suffer depression Perhaps a surprising result of the pandemic is that as one observer put it God has had a good lockdown Attendance at online services has soared Yet this innovation brings its own stresses for clergy Theres a much bigger potential audience out there The Bishop might log on for heavens sake But also their flock can now view whats on offer elsewhere and some might stray Others might get out of the way of physically attending church Many churches face tricky competing demands between traditional and modern worship Younger people moan that hymns plod along but Ive heard perplexed older folk ask why the blokes with the guitars always sound so anguished when singing about something so joyful For many nowadays the ceremonies around the Dukes funeral will have seemed quaint remote perhaps even alien Even before the scandals of recent years church attendances were falling especially among the young The communities which once sustained congregations are ageing At least adults in the pews now are there because they want to be there not from social pressure Still just the day after his role in the Dukes obsequies Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby was in Downpatrick as the Methodist church there closed its doors for the last time So what many will say But one wonders what social glue will bind communities in their stead and though perhaps derided what message is relayed by Twitter that replaces love thy neighbour Baptisms for example had a social role in introducing newborns to a network of friends and family Foodbanks are sustained by church collections Some resent the role the Salvation Army and St Vincent de Paul play in relieving homelessness and hardship but there are precious few stepping forward to replace the key services they provide One things for sure the slack isnt going to be taken up by the state or by Facebook So maybe just a little slack should be cut for clerical collars like those who gathered in north Belfast recently to help quell the frenzy of teenage rioters Maybe it didnt work maybe it was a bit ridiculous But for all the sound and fury on the airwaves and theoreticians on social media there were very few prepared to stand between the rioters and the police officers taking a hammering As the old saying attributed to St Francis has it preach the gospel always when necessary use words Whether those words run to the Dukes pithy eight minutes or a rambling minutes it says something about those committed to church life that they still think their place is where trouble is The long and the short of it is thats something we should still be grateful for  Zusammenfassung der Suche TextRoman Catholic Church or Church of Ireland or

Carrickfergus High School and have worked in insurance and banking as well as years in the Northern Trust taking early retirement in July Q How and when did you come to faith A Carrickfergus Congregational was the family church and we also went to the Salvation Army afternoon Sunday School Midweek I went to Junior Soldiers in the Salvation Army and at seven or eight I responded to the Gospel message In both congregations I was nurtured and encouraged in faith Alan and I were married in Carrickfergus Congregational in May but as we had bought a house in Glengormley we made his church St Brigids Church of Ireland our spiritual home My faith was challenged here through Lenten talks based on a book by John Ortberg If You Want to Walk on Water Youve Got to Get Out of the Boat I was encouraged to apply for Diocesan Lay Reader training which began in and I was commissioned in It was the beginning of an amazing exciting yet challenging voyage which led to my spiritual mooring

been angry with God A No although I have lamented to God We should take all things to the Lord He wants to hear about our pain as much as our joy Q Do you ever get criticised for your faith and are you able to live with that criticism A As a street pastor I was faced with criticism sometimes It could have been caused by various factors such as the persons drunkenness atheist views or their personal experiences with religion I was trained to care listen and help so criticism was never taken personally Q Are you ever ashamed of your own church or denomination ANo As my own church

their dedication and faithfulness to their congregations Q Are you afraid to die or can you look beyond death AIm not afraid of death as I know I will be going to the Lord I would be sad to leave

We can learn from people of other faiths and respect and dialogue are key Q Are the churches fulfilling their mission A The statistical results for religion in Northern Ireland should be a wakeup call for all churches They need to stop being insular to look deep within themselves and outside too and be relevant in their local context demonstrating the love of God in practical ways serving the needs of the people on their doorstep as well as further afield Now is the time to become the church that Christ expects us to be and raise up the next generation of Godled leaders Q Why are so many people turning their backs on organised religion A The world is rapidly changed and changing with secularisation and religion has often caused more harm than good People are free to make their own choices how and where they spend their time and money and religious institutions are seen as largely irrelevant in their chosen lifestyle Yet the Gospel message remains as relevant as ever and people of today more than ever before need hope Q Has religion helped or hindered in Northern Ireland A Religion here has hindered its people inciting fear and dividing communities But it has also helped in the peace process bringing individuals and communities together Q Some personal preferences favourite TV programme book music and why A Favourite TV programme Call the Midwife favourite films would be any of the Star Wars or Lord of the Rings and favourite song is If I can dream by Elvis I love to read but I have no favourite author Q Where do you feel closest to God A In the everyday things of life particularly when out walking Q The inscription on your gravestone if any will leave that to the family AI major regrets QAny God has been and is good ANo

raising funds for hospice that cared for siblingsmum One woman bought our biscuitsbut they looked so real her partner tried to eat them Each knit can take hours but its time well spent say sisters KNITTED cakes and biscuits that look good enough to eat are making their way into the kitchens of little and big kids thanks to the creativity of two Belfast sisters Retired school teachers Lynda Wallace and Suzanne Kelly are selling their beautifully crafted fancies through a new charity they have set up in aid of Marie Curie called Knitted Food Inc Every penny from the sale of their fruitladen pavlova slices pretty pink doughnuts and many other sweet treats goes to the charity as a thank you from the women for the care and support given to their late mum Elizabeth Kelly during her final days Lifelong knitter Lynda is the creative force behind the artistic venture while sister Suzanne takes care of the promotion orders and deliveries With the charity only having been launched in November the sisters are delighted that some of their first customers are coming back for seconds after friends and family marvelled at how realistic Lyndas creations were While the knits were initially aimed at children adults have bought them as display items for kitchens The sisters were devastated when their mum Elizabeth was diagnosed with terminal breast cancer just before the start of the pandemic in early She spent her final two weeks being cared for in Belfasts Marie Curie Hospice where she passed away in July Now as the charity prepares to launch its annual Daffodil Appeal the girls are hoping their creations will boost its coffers Suzanne said We set up the business to support Marie Curie and in memory of mum Mum was cared for in the charitys east Belfast hospice and we feel indebted to the staff for the care and dignity they gave not just to mum but to us too It was especially difficult because of Covid and lockdown restrictions but they really did make the pain of losing her as easy as it could be Suzanne who lives in Holywood taught at the Belfast School of Music before she retired She plays the piano and the organ and is the musical director of the Regent Street Presbyterian Church in Newtownards Lynda who lives in Dundonald taught sciences at Antrim Grammar School before her retirement She is married to Norman a retired aircraft inspector and they have two daughters Julie and Lisa and one grandson Thomas who is five It was Thomas who inspired Lynda a lifelong knitter to start creating food items as toys She explained My grandson loved playing with the kitchen at playgroup so we bought him one of his own in I knitted him a lemon meringue pie It didnt look right but he was happy with it so I knitted him some biscuits I then Googled food knits and did a few other things Thomas played with them rather than the plastic food so I knitted cakes with layers as it made them more solid and easier to wash In after mum passed away I said to Suzanne If I knit will you sell to raise money for Marie Curie It went from there Lynda spent the guts of the next two years knitting to build up stock before Suzanne launched the charity on Facebook in November of last year She now has items perfected through trial and error Her range includes realistic pavlova slices cheesecake Victoria sponge and other favourites such as Jammie Dodgers and custard creams Suzanne took her first batch to a Christup mas fair in her local church where the knits were snapped up She said business had boomed ever since adding I sold quite a lot at the Christmas fair and then had people coming back and saying they were great and asking for more Lynda is a bit of a perfectionist so the detail on them is incredible People have commented they cant believe how realistic they are We thought they would be bought solely as toys for children to play with but we have so many adults who bought them too One woman put some biscuits she bought on a plate for display in her kitchen She told us her husband came in and lifted one to eat thinking it was the real thing She came back and ordered more for her friends The sisters cover the cost of the wool and dont charge for the many hours it takes Lynda to make each knit A single slice of cake can take to nine hours to perfect but sells for just £ with biscuits £ each or five for £ So far they have raised around £ for the charity through sales It is a positive response to a shattering loss for the sisters who were both very close to their mum BUSY Suzanne said I never faced grief like it before I feel as if a part of me died with my mum and Lynda has been very affected too Mum was so full of life She was going on She loved her clothes and was so busy you had to make an appointment to see her She played bridge all her life Her diagnosis came out of the blue To lose her just seven months later was such a shock We set up the charity in her memory and as long as Lynda is happy to keep knitting I am happy to keep selling We will keep going and hopefully it will help the wonderful work of Marie Curie Lynda has created knitting patterns for all the items in the range and is hoping to add more She said I have loads of ideas in my head I realised that everything I have knitted so far wouldnt be the healthiest of foods so I hope to add some fruit and vegetables to the range Ive seen a knitted breakfast online which I think would be fun too It was a shock to lose mum and it was very hard because of lockdown too Anything we can do to help Marie Curie we will do because they have been so good Suzanne and Lynda will be marking the loss of their mother on March Marie Curies National Day of Reflection The occasion provides an opportunity to remember loved ones who have died while supporting people who are still grieving It starts with a minutes silence at noon and includes a nationwide network of Walls of Reflection and online programmes To see the sisters full
